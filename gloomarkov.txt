(Sorry if I am noob there urmum, Im not very good with managing Pip lol)
(sorry, I am very mad right now but not at you)
(That isnt shovelware)
(This is a concept for a JS-Only page, which I hope to use across the website) Kinda like rc24.xyz, but it's BC24.
(which isnt a too bad idea?)
(WIP, some web fonts still need to be added, but hell, it works well!)
***YAHOO***
**DEADLYFOEZ** :Pog:
............. Thats -- Ok, I hope he knows that's illegal to use my pfp without my permission.

20 mins and my devs are still debating on how strict moderation should be, hoping we can make BC24 discord more apporaite than how BC24 discord used to be.
:ahuman: Ok, why is this emote called what it's called?
:Banned: Maybe you get admin..? 😛
:CMOCLoading: Since when did we have this emote 👀
:GoldRacc: Nom nom nom, https://6100mifi-server-001.000webhostapp.com/cdn/html4.html
:Kappa: I dont even know about what half of the stuff you have lol 😛
:Kappa: It does that every darn time.
:mattclock: Hey baconz, Arturo made me a emote which was cool. ```:mattclock``` will allow you to use it, o and look really closely and you can see the https://rc24.xyz/favicon.ico image
:mattclock: lel

================================================================wine: '/root/.wine' is a 64-bit installation, it cannot be used with a 32-bit wineserver.
>>strike 1 @Larsenv This isn’t your project nor your server. It is not your place to kick me out of my own project.
?
???
@23Sonics Yeah, his WC24 docs were actually the basis for my project.
@AdamCrossing No, WAD's filesystem is not only not big enough, but its filesystem is too inferior to ISO/WBFS
@Alexsky15 :poggers: Teach me that sometime. I cant believe you actually got that partially working :pogchamp:
@Alexsky15 Omfg you are a asbolute god, please send me your NAND in DMs
@Andry That is the shittest repack I have ever seen. I should KNOW, considering I MAKE them.
@Andry Yea apologizes for that, I actually am just ignoring Terwebz now, like when some other fellow moderators from a now dead server said, dont let people like that get to ya. So, no more, I promise.
@Anthonyjrvill You do that. And can you do the same with the earth's core?
@Artuto Here, Ill make it up to you for how I have been... wait for it..... boom! boosted!
@Artuto Hope im not bothering anything Artuto, but since KcrPl is offline, could you handle this mate?
@Artuto https://prnt.sc/uaj9gy Throwback. Ah the early days of RGD. 😄
@Artuto I have a cool wii one also, sorry for ping but can you add this emote too? I even added the rc24 favicon on the clock to please ya 😄
@Auto1lija Will try to credit you more, sorry if you were insivible for a while.
@axiot I would confer with JG on that, I gtg 🙂
@axiot Whats the geocoding server we have? 🙂
@Baconz iirc you and me I think are the same, or at the least around Dark's height.
@Baconz Ill dm you it.
@Baconz It worked! https://prnt.sc/u48n9w
@Baconz lel, I can give you a much better version
@Baconz Miss me? 🙂 Good to be back.
@Baconz There's a reason for that. The 3ds protected agaisnt flashcarts, so they advertised on flashcarts, and said hey, we bypassed it boi!
@Baconz You think you have problems? Rufus thinks its open, yet it shows nowhere in Task Mangaer
@Baconz ||~~Soon your brain will be cooked bacon. ~~||https://bitbuilt.net/images/guide_hub/console_modding/wii/compendium/[PUBLIC%20RELEASE%20FULL]%20-%20Wii%20RVK-01%20Compendium.pdn The ultimate Wii hack. See you guys tommorow, Ill let you play with this 😄
@bell the marble You want one? I'll give you a answer. Gimme a minute.
@D2 Why did you do that lol 🤨
@Dark14 @jordiisepic DM me for password, hope you like it 🙂
@Dark14 Ill take kyle2000 memes, 300 😛
@Dark14 Its gloom hehe
@Dark14 Just wanted to say hi Dark, it has been a month since we last met. Im excited to show you in a few days what I have been working on.
@Dark14 Quack! Quack! 🦆
@Deleted User ?? What's happening?
@Deleted User Fly away human, never return.
@Deleted User Good lord child, delete it you dodo/egghead. 😛
@Deleted User GTFO, meanie.
@Deleted User Hahahahaha, Idc
@Deleted User Hey! What have you got agisant weebs?! Me and Saetta can be a weeb if we damn well want, darnit. 😛
@Deleted User How bout.. no!
@Deleted User I'll play with you guys w/ Ishiiruka tommorow, can you leave the stuff in my DM's so I can have it ready for tommorow maybe?
@Deleted User Ill give you a free copy of Betternet, DM me.
@Deleted User Nitro? Well why didnt you guys just say so? 😄
@Deleted User Not to worry, I will execute this bot. https://prnt.sc/u9qnh9
@Deleted User Ok, to be fair. I know this sounds harsh, but you are making me uncomformtble. Please just shut up..
@Deleted User ||Aim for Cammie Dunaway, amirite? :P||
@dhtdht020 @Larsenv Sorry to ping mates, but just had the strangest idea. What if, for the mail system, we employ hash encryption to bring down the size of a field. Basically, I had a idea to do a SQL database to store the CRC32 hashes, and then from that we can combine as many fields as we want into it, and when we do the text to crc32, the crc32 hash is checked agaisnt the one in the database in a way that would allow it to read back the data. I am thinking of trying out snowflake though, if there is enough interest, I can try to code a POC rn. CRC32 is admittingly smaller though, so that was sorta my thinking process.
@dhtdht020 Had a weird idea. It is possible to encrypt a text file to a .lz file right? I know its random, but I was pondering that today.
@dhtdht020 JSON of homebrew themes? Thats cool actually, so like homebrew browser wise, you install them?
@dhtdht020 Night dht, live long in prosper 🖖
@dhtdht020 Would any of these tools help your project dht? 🙂 https://github.com/WiiLink24
@dhtdht020 Yea that reminds me, can I talk to you via DM’s for a sec.
@dmgr_ https://prnt.sc/u37vfz So I took some old weird german mistranslations from my 000webhost server and it did this... please have matt knock me out in Wii boxing before I die laughing 🤣
@dmgr_ Yes.
@Dogmander :Kappa: 
@Dogmander @Snoot 🐾 https://6100m.github.io/Gigatron/index.html
@Dogmander Anyway, dogmander could you look over my code and review it perhaps?
@Dogmander At this point, Im thinking of just hosting it on yours permenatly, although I am unsure.
@Dogmander Can you maybe patch Forecast WAD to go to domains? Im spreading out the work so we can be done today. :) I can send you the domains in a hour if you are able to? Heres the plan though, you patch forecast, spotlight patches rsa-1, and I setup the domains, unbound, cron jobs, and the script :)
@Dogmander CDN is being re-done, will post link in 5 mins.
@Dogmander I call dibs! 🙂
@Dogmander I did send contributor access to the RiiNoMa account too btw
@Dogmander I think you broke perms lol. https://prnt.sc/uhvr9y
@Dogmander I'm going to base your MC server engine I'm making for ya off of Hypixel. Neat huh?
@Dogmander If you mean the downloading in the patcher, then yeah. I warned you guys NUS would die...
@Dogmander Im back!
@Dogmander In a week. 🙂
@Dogmander it'll be side by side in wc24 dev and this channel, I gtg but see ya later 🙂
@Dogmander No Im not 😛 Also Dogmander, check out my new Win7 install 🙂 https://prnt.sc/wa0v8r
@Dogmander Server ready for me to cross-deploy?
@Dogmander Speaking of which though, could you ask Larsen to unblock me? There's a few more things I need his help with, particularly with DLC and syscheck 🙂
@Dogmander The whole page, yeah.
@Dogmander 🐕‍🦺 Letsago! 🙂
@ELPresentsTTS LOL dont make me hungry! :DroolCat:
@everyone 2/3 server is deployed.
@everyone Anyone wanna come see the inital work on NWFC? Streaming a bit of it over in VC.
@everyone Forecast, EVC, and CMOC coming this week and the next. (To my devs, thats the deadline I wanna meet with those three)
@everyone https://github.com/WiiLink24 We have a github now! :vulpix_uwu:
@everyone If I forgot to give you tester role, sorry. Please DM me if I said I would since I forgot and I will give you the role.
@everyone If I leave VC unexpectedly, I wasnt mad, my power just went out. SOMETHING weird is happening in my house and we might be moving to Dogmander's server until TMinus gets his NAS going, which hopefully will be soon.
@everyone Server is looking pretty great so far, wish I could be here this week! I will be back soon, IRL issues until 9/14/2020 then I will be back. Stay tuned! Hoping to get Forecast/News/EVC done next week.
@everyone So few jobs open.
@everyone Streaming BC24 Site tech demos, hop over to VC guys! 🙂 (Lets see if we can hit 10 users to beat our record of 5 🙂 )
@everyone Testing partial Wii No Ma server and forecast today, not much left! Thanks @TMinusBlastedRocket for fixing EVC on our server too, and thanks to Larsen for explaining votes.py args to me as well :)
@fluffy @Deleted User Cant get it to work, I think its broken, I have to reconnect haha
@fluffy @RedBees So in short mates, a request page is out there somewhere for a Gekko. https://prnt.sc/u5xtpz I just wish I knew where
@fluffy Alr fluffy, so from here, run uup_download_windows.cmd as admin, and you are good to go 😄
@fluffy https://prnt.sc/urlbtk Here was some very old stuff I have, that very few people have. I have extremely rare stuff, such as https://prnt.sc/urlc8f. Think I should release to RGD?
@fluffy I have source code for a usb-gecko! Gimme one min, Ill give it to you.
@fluffy Perhaps a web host server for you and me? Maybe even one that can host bots and whatever we develop?
@fluffy Wait, wii was going to have stocks? Interesting, there MIGHT actually be more documentation on this somewhere, maybe iwata interviews?
@fluffy Wii No Ma servers are still alive, this ACTUALLY might be possible, :Pog:
@fluffy Will hang out with you and SabbathBond tommorow, I was just checking in; I got schoolwork sadly 😛
@fluffy Yep its a pcb, Im replicating this little fella. https://prnt.sc/tj9nyb
@fluffy Yo fluffy, have a favor to ask of ya.
@fluffy you there fluffy? Or like, you resting or somethin ol' buddy? Wanna ask ya something 😄
@GameBreaker64 BootMii Boot2 + Priiloader? With that, you cant fail as long as you make a NAND backup in Bootmii before too thouhg.
@Gamerappa And EVEN if you did, you would have a mail brick. (which you wouldnt get them anyway!)
@Gamerappa It explained why, here you go lol.
@GamerKGR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdJgeHuTnZQ On the topic of Opera
@hxper HOW DID IT..... I dont even wanna know what the AI thought. :xding: @Saetta06 No it did, it's just silent. 64dd bios, on the other hand, actually has a GUI. Ultra 64's bios is more of a hidden BIOS at that.
@hxper I am not 😛
@hxper I dont know HOW to respond to that image 😛
@hxper On the contary, it actually makes it easier. :)
@hxper Well, your CDN works! 🙂 Webhooks went off without a hitch, its now a matter of me and my other devs debugging, then we should be good.
@Imora https://discordapp.com/channels/750581992223146074/755448683872518205/783788678623133777 Here is the product key stuff I posted.
@Imora Yay! New domain 🙂 6100m.ga
@jaggerboi14 Lol, you should know where 😛
@JG 
@JG @Dogmander Are you two able to host permeantly? Im going to cross-deploy. 🙂
@JG @Snoot 🐾 Going to see if I can implement more types of merch, any ideas for types of merch (like fair freebies you guys like or somethin?)
@JG @Snoot 🐾 Hey guys, hope I'm not disturbing anything, but just wanted to give you guys some updates on the Digicam recieving engine and ShopSDK. I took a bath this afternoon and while in there thought long and hard about everything we still need to do, and I have a plan. I just have some questions along with it though, as I'm not sure on a few things.
@JG Added some of my tools 🙂
@JG Added the AS3 submodule to the script, flappy is best. 🙂
@JG Alright, can I have SSH? Im going to deploy NWFC on it 🙂
@JG Also, I noticed you reversed that RFL mii thing, nice. I'm going to be reversing LZ and WC24 containers personally 🙂
@JG And here is the full version (sorry for two pings haha)
@JG but yeah, can you fix up the file-maker fork? 🙂
@JG Can you map Pokemon Cooking to my mii maybe?
@JG Could you maybe be our third tester? I always do three tests to be sure 🙂
@JG Here is my Mii 🙂 Complete with format changer w/ all deps it needs!
@JG https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AhiqOmhw1eA9NNgqtnpjB_f10WtatCrh?usp=sharing here's the first part
@JG I mean, you should prob do a cron job on your server to do it though 😅
@JG I would ask Larsen for it, I dont wanna break TOS 😛
@JG Im adding code logging/scanning 🙂
@JG Its illegial to distribute the tools, they wont care if you distribute a mobilcip you created from it, they just care about the tools being distributed.
@JG Linked to my domains now 🙂
@JG Optical recongition client. I use it for schoolwork all the time, ABBYY FineReader is the best one
@JG setting that site up was painful :( At least we have it done now. If only I knew what is breaking cron jobs.
@JG Yeah, I have it 🙂
@JG ✋
@JG 🍪 Nice, you're learning well 🙂 Have a cookie!
@jordiisepic Congrats Jordan, Im proud of you! :smile:
@jordiisepic Eh its been a while since Ive done it, nvm then haha
@jordiisepic Forgot to ask, would you like to test too when it is ready?
@jordiisepic Got permission, check your PMs.
@jordiisepic If you want any help, feel free to DM me and chat with me, Im lonely during covid.
@jordiisepic One more thing, be sure to execute the sub bot alongside it (bin/ebay-dumper-subbot-v1.exe)
@jordiisepic Ta-da! https://6100mifi-server-001.000webhostapp.com/cdn/html6.html Looks like it was written in HTML doesnt it? 🙂 Look closer at the source code, it's entirely JS.
@jordiisepic you can play with these too if ya want :)
@jordiisepic You know, at first your voice sorta got me, but then I rerembered my voice sucks unlike yours + I realize you are a cool guy. Nice to meet you, I'm one of fluffy/redbees's kubos, I find console schematics for us to play with because we like that stuff.
@Korfi I like that one.
@Larsenv
@Larsenv
@Larsenv ??? This is a weird pic I have from E3 2006...
@Larsenv And it is possible Ig. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi-irHxhMPqAhUVsJ4KHXarBfYQFjADegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F41336909%2Fplay-flac-from-resources-of-web-server-in-html&usg=AOvVaw01-jOxHwnzKE4PcoKBlrIP
@Larsenv Finally, your Mariocube assets get some love! :smile:
@Larsenv Hah. I tried to explain it in the simplest terms I could hehe.
@Larsenv Hey larsen, forgot to say happy late birthday! :)
@Larsenv Hey larsen, sorry to ping, but I wanted to say that sorry if I have been annoying lately, Ill try to be better I got some more wii schematic and devkit stuff up my sleeve, so Im hoping to get that released to ya on Monday. Here is one of the things I have. here is a Intec Gamecube/(Wii too?) 2.4GHZ Wireless transmitter schematic. Wish I could speak right now to tell you this, but my parents arent letting me speak in VC :/
@Larsenv Hey Larsen, wanted to ask you something really quick. Is there a public method for archiving sites on my own PC to a WARC file? There is a onion mirror site I am trying to grab, but wget barely grabs anything from it. Like, I know for a fact that there is more than this, that or I am doing something wrong. https://prnt.sc/u5qnlt
@Larsenv Holy shit, I just had the greatest idea. What if we put Kirby TV channel's videos into it?
@Larsenv How bout it then Larsen? Should we give it a go?
@Larsenv https://discordapp.com/channels/750581992223146074/750623609810190348/790026738863702036 I have been getting better. https://prnt.sc/w6b8it I'll practice non-stop until I've satisified you and gotten to the skill I need 😄
@Larsenv https://prnt.sc/vul5eu Here is one of the VM's I made, the second is still installing rn
@Larsenv I did it Larsen! 🙂 https://prnt.sc/upnmtz
@Larsenv I mean, that Wii number system could work.
@Larsenv I need a way to keep my beagle from eating my burger king food lol, Im eating it on the couch and she is nudging me with her snout constantly lol :p
@Larsenv I think we have our winner, flac.js will be used for the POC tonight. Mariocube has FLAC of wii banners, right?
@Larsenv I want to develop forecast/Wii no ma at the same time, it doesn't get in the way.
@Larsenv Larsen, how does this whole Wii Sports CMOC thing work? Do they appear as spectators or something?
@Larsenv now I want one :grabby: 🙂
@Larsenv Quick question Larsen, how do you actually make that DNS server? Im trying to learn how 🙂
@Larsenv Root-CA00000001
@Larsenv Theoretically, had an idea for how we log WC24 stuff in dolphin, could we just have a client that directly aggreates from mtw.rc24.xyz
@Larsenv This is the funniest one yet. (That I came out with)
@Larsenv Was looking through File-Maker, you put newspaper3k instead of newspaper and the cmoc config has two unused variables (miicontest(p)_path and both of them are unused.
@Larsenv well whatddya know, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35273358/determine-how-many-times-webpage-has-been-accessed you can log how many times people access conntest! 🙂
@Larsenv You did it, yay! Also how did you get Wii U quality Mii pics tho?
@Larsenv You do realize I am doing it to beneift you. Would you rather have untested code? Well betterconnect24 allows me to test optimizations and edits.
@Link What if we made a bot that can execute a python script on the server?
@LMG07 That is beyond fucking cursed 0.o
@LMG07 WAIIITTTT how is Sega genesis pumping out non-pixel art graphics?
@Marko Hey marko, can you come over to VC?
@mint https://prnt.sc/u37uba
@mint https://prnt.sc/uubydp This will be a feature for the server. I must be going now, see you later today 🙂
@mint I mean, I dont see why not 🤔
@mint In case I forget.. happy birthday. Truly the best of times, no?
@mint Its a little late for that 😅 We already have the domain named it and whatnot, it would suck to change it
@Mkwii64 Ask dogmander to give the translators that job 🙂
@Mkwii64 Eh, to better RC24. Also, does also managing EVC polls sound good to ya? 🙂
@Mkwii64 Forecast is perfect atm
@Mkwii64 I cant say I am a fan of it fully, but I will probably learn to adjust to it over time. So in short, I for the most part like it.
@Mkwii64 Larsen told me how to do cron jobs of how to run CMOC, so thanks to him 🙂 I will try to get you a contest maker soon 😄
@Mkwii64 My setup for that.
@Obsidian Plague Ill help you fix it lol.
@Paniaal Alright, I helped one of the devs by offering him to do a server setup for him, to allow him to have WUS and these ones too. Glad to help you both you guys in which all three of us shares a common interest in Wii No Ma.
@Paniaal Name it George!
@Paniaal O and when you get back, Ill invite you to a Demae channel development server (nothing too big has started yet)
@pengu Lol I WILL give you a copy of Aomei Partition Assistant to fix it if you want.
@pengu UH that does scare me too actually lol.
@Plastic Dat's a bizzare little DC. 😛
@Raphael I posted a much sexier one here too https://discordapp.com/channels/206934458954153984/258999527783137280/744377056493568090 :3
@RedBees wc24tool had several successful pilot tests, 4/5 reported it working! 🙂 Releasing in RGD soon...
@RedBees Yeah we corrupted it via savestates, it was OP 😄 (We are still streaming over in Jenna roll if you wanna come and see)
@Reely Im second place! 🙂 https://prnt.sc/uoj0ao
@Sabbath Силверханд I need to debug the formatting on Forecast File-Maker v1.1
@Sabbath Силверханд Python, not efficent atm, but that is being worked out.
@Saetta06 Excellent job on that one too, the Optimized for Xbox thing is on there too which is excellent 🖖
@Saetta06 Hmmmm ok. Gimme a min.
@Saetta06 I did stick up for you and all, please dont be mad at me anymore. https://prnt.sc/um4653
@Saetta06 That's because your phone has a more HQ recording codec.
@Saetta06 Yeah seatta, let's not shoot the messenger. (I mean, you don't want RC24 to break up/fight anymore about this, and I dont)
@sdhsako @fluffy Apologizes I would play but
@sdhsako And I will ENSURE brick code wont occur, I think I might reach out to Star or maybe ask Spotlight if we can patch it?
@sdhsako Bow down to the bearer of e3 2004 tech demos! 😛 https://prnt.sc/tm8wgm
@sdhsako https://prnt.sc/u5t6qz :dab
@sdhsako I can prob do a few of the dev channels yea 😄
@sdhsako Just a note: :WiiConnect24: Put this emote as the all logs emote. (If that works) Oh, and by the way, maybe we should make a rule for people to be a bit more apporaite. Refer to Message ``ID: 757974623240323202``
@sdhsako No, but I will gladly play MKW with you on dolphin.
@sdhsako Roblox doesnt have anti cheat :thonkang:
@sdhsako Well I mean the Wii only takes 100 miis, but ig through patching there is a 1/1000 chance it would be patchable.
@Shraqil Can I be in that pic? Just draw me as a gloom or somethin 😛
@Shraqil No I am a weeb. 😛
@Sneexy On the contrary, we will.
@Snoot 🐾 :pika_cool: 
@Snoot 🐾 @Dogmander All of my repos from now on will have extensive code scanning 🙂 Also, I did end up deciding to do a VM, but in the mean time while it installs I will work on Forecast 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 @JG @TMinusBlastedRocket https://github.com/6100m/Gigatron/tree/main
@Snoot 🐾 Actually quick question Spotlight: I have some Wii No Ma show backups, should I encode them, or are we good for now? 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Ay, I will have two VM's, dogmander's VM is the unbound, his server is the CoWFC, and your VM is the main server 🙂 I heard that Unbound runs best on OpenBSD? 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Can we maybe turn this into a schema? This is something I have planned for the server, and I kinda wanna make it a schema instead of manually inputing things 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Can you fix the JSON again maybe Snoot? I gtg to bed :)
@Snoot 🐾 Dogmander's authentication is broken on his server, could you maybe fix it? 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Ehhh should I use grafana instead? It might save money.
@Snoot 🐾 Going to try to run the script again, I wil let you know if it errors 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Hey snoot, could you maybe see if we can get Cacti hooked up to my Fedora VM, so I can get some of the stuff deployed? I'm thinking of probably having a little bit of the US service put onto Cacti, forecast and mail and WUS to be exact, since Wii No Ma will use those three. That, and could I maybe hook my domains into our Cloudflare account too maybe?
@Snoot 🐾 Hey snoot, how did you get the VM running btw? Im going to be deploying a second VM on dogmander's server, a OpenBSD one that I will chain with Unbound 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Hey spotlight, I was thinking of porting File-Maker to Go? Wanna collab? 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Hey spotlight, you know Techincabor right? 🙂 He checked up on the DLC server, it is nwcs 😄
@Snoot 🐾 https://prnt.sc/uv37vc
@Snoot 🐾 https://prnt.sc/uyr79a Thats the fix thing you're running right?
@Snoot 🐾 I can go into webmin and investigate if needed, in case you need a extra hand 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 I ran CMOC.py, but it didnt do anything? I think I have to cron job them in a certain order?
@Snoot 🐾 I will be generating that list today :) 6100m.ga will have most of them, but I will create the list of subdomain names today with my new tool :)
@Snoot 🐾 Ill add the software for us to use to the organization 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 maybe we could look into it?
@Snoot 🐾 Oh no Snoot, I don't know if I will make the videos in time, 😦 It's taking forever, going to try a 8 vid queue and maybe, just maybe, it might be done soon.
@Snoot 🐾 Reason I'm bringing this up is because let's say, Wii No Ma show backups, or heck even DSI Shop, could we just have a local server to provide things like this to people, if they have the archive.org backups?
@Snoot 🐾 so snoot, cmoc fixed? 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Thanks for letting me be a dev again Snoot, I promise to be a good gloom :)
@Snoot 🐾 That would be ok, yes 🙂 I'll have you do that though, but yeah, I plan to edit them at some point, as some do need mods to work in my configuration 🙂 I just am editing them one by one
@Snoot 🐾 These are all the cron jobs I registered, yeah, something is up. Running it normal without cron is fine, but when I cron job it, it fails?
@Snoot 🐾 Well, all the repos have logging now, plus lots of new software. https://github.com/WiiLink24 I think Ill prob head out for the day 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 What am I going to do? O gosh, I am about to run Wii No Ma on dolphinios, I'll screenshot it if it works, this should be fun 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Whatcya guys doin? Reversing Wii No Ma? 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Will be working with you guys in a couple hours, school work and all.
@Snoot 🐾 Will do Snoot 🙂 Im going to test EVC now, I hope it works 🙂
@Snoot 🐾 Would you maybe be able to go in and fork em all tonight perhaps?
@squeakycleanswine Well, you didnt do too bad. I would space it out like this however.
@Susan Wolizardi I got you covered 😄
@Susan Wolizardi Yeah, but did your town go to anarchy like mine? Thousands of fireworks were fired in my town till 2 am and everyone went bonkers in my town. (Literally every square inch, boom, boom, boom! 😦 )
@TerWebz And I use my stardust dragon to zap out your LP, you're dead 😛
@TerWebz Maybe that's why they dont put Luigi in a game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDt8-6QQAXc
@TerWebz Not half bad, I know you got hello right.
@TerWebz Oh but alas, you are Luigi! Mario is already married to Peach, and you clean sewers.
@TerWebz That is enough! You are making me over the edge. Stop the stupid shitpost, you 8 year old jesus christ, what's the matter with ya.
@TheFearlessDeath500 Very well then, just be a bit patient.
@thet10 Mac and cheese of course! Epic food 🤤
@thet10 Ok that one freaks me out XD
@TMinusBlastedRocket
@TMinusBlastedRocket Almost, yes 🙂
@TMinusBlastedRocket Alr, see you there 🙂
@TMinusBlastedRocket Im going to try to get EVC working right now, I will be doing a quick patch 🙂
@TMinusBlastedRocket The creator of Luigi/O made a bot, me and him had fun testing it and all, ready for you to setup however ya like.
@TMinusBlastedRocket You got it hosted? :Pog:
@unowe I might actually use that, it runs decent both on Pi 3 and 4 right?
@UnsignedDriver If you mean me, here is what's included. https://prnt.sc/u3tapv
@urmum_69 As promised, we got a curator. Also urmum, as for that messevideo, I will have er ready in 20 mins. Hope ya enjoy! 🙂
@urmum_69 Good morning urmum, 👋 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rh8gMvzPw0
@urmum_69 My self-hosted one isnt ready yet, Im getting it put up so I dont have to use 000webhost anymore.
@urmum_69 Wanna see something that'll knock your socks off? :CoolRBird:
@Voaly Be warned however, NEVER SOLDER DIRECTLY TO A STORAGE DRIVE, EVER. It will brick your storage unit.
@Voaly Hey there's me! 😄
@Voaly Hope im not distirbuting anything Voaly, but can you take care of this perhaps?
@Voaly Morning Voaly, I have something to show ya! 🙂 https://prnt.sc/upnmtz
@Voaly Please unmute me lol
@Voaly Yeah, on Rc24 use the mii avatar thingy, and use mii installer in tandem. Boom, youre good to go 😄
@Voaly Yeah, same here. Mind if I show you one of my class projects? 0.o
@WhatIsTheName Greetings, small human. 🖖
@Yoshi128k And we aren't going to do that with RC24, why do you think we would (Apologies for sounding snappy, Im a bit batty rn)
@Yoshi128k Are you aware of stop.virus.exe? I MEAN IT LUL
@Yoshi128k Bye bye now, let's see if Mario cares for you at the castle at w1-boss
@Yoshi128k Click here, easy.
@Yoshi128k Good lord, never, never tell me what to do!
@Yoshi128k 🔕
@zjtech123 Catch ya later man, cheers on getting that workin! 🙂
@zjtech123 Ofc I have a really hacky way you can do this.
@zjtech123 Oh they’ll be well written, ill show you my best code samples in vc this afternoon.

``m0b!cl!p4ulz`` Lulz indeed, over my ass 😛
``Not I, said the gloom`` Why I am biblobical at times is beyond me.
A bit actually, Im just waiting for Spotlight to get our sentry server online. 🙂
A HTML file written purely in JS! https://6100mifi-server-001.000webhostapp.com/cdn/html6.html
A little bit more than that actually.
A little curious, I saw that in your archive.org profile and I thought it was cool.
A little yes. But nevertheless, yes I can be annoying. I just wish I could be left be a bit.
A lot of managing had to be done, so I would write tools to help me. Here is two random scripts I wrote to do stuff like that.
A lot, it is better in every way (that, and I mean its better for iOS jailbreak research) As for the VPNS, I basically just stockpile versions of em.
A web asset pack, better than my old cdn in every way (rerember pikacdn?)
Achieved first dolphin NAND switcher, greetz @sdhsako and fluffy and redbees for the positive encouragement and their friendlyness during this project's development + testing/additional code work and debugging 😄
Actually
Actually https://prnt.sc/u3op3c he's still here on my screen :/
Actually I cant really explain well why, but you will see later on.
Actually Larsen, Im new to cgi, how would I go about doing that
Actually nvm I still have typos, Ill wait on that haha
Actually nvm that was just a old exploit I got from Github, a IOS 1.0 jailbreak actually 🙂
Actually snoot, me and Glitch did force enable FastCGI on everything, although I hope that isn't the case. God that was a month ago, things have changed since 🙂 (Also hope you dont mind this Snoot, but I will upload ShopSDK over webmin and I'll post the path here in a min)
Actually the URL was there, oops one sec.
Actually yeah, leave Voaly alone, he's a good guy.
Actually yes, we both do. In fact, I've actually publicly said that a few times now I think.
Actually you have a point there, I might just keep US/EU on flipserve.
Actually, I could try to upload to mega.nz, one min
Actually, I prefer UAC / AV bypass. Sure, its not practical, but it makes debugging painless for me.
Actually, this one is, it's not bloated + it has a good skinpack
Agreed Larsen, agreed. (Speaking of which, is waninoko still around?)
Agreed urmum, I will keep silent until I can get the beta going. But yeah, Im sorta just trying. Well, I do have vff's and wireshark logs, that's all atm. Wdym btw?
Agreed yeah haha.
Agreed yes :p
Agreed, I even tested the curl bug and sure enough, its patched which is good. So other than subdomain scans being possible (which I will get that security bug patched out) nevertheless, I think our mail system is now perfect. 😄
Agreed, I will make channels for them then. 🙂
Agreed, yes 🙂
Agreed, yes.
Ah I thought it was global, nvm haha.
Ah kinda like a temporary mockup similar to the SMG's snythesiser temp mockup?
Ah Larsen, youre just the man I wanted to see. I was wondering if you knew of a good food API? Im weighing the possiblity of Demae, and GrubHub's API is locked down tight.
Ah one sec Arturo, Ill fix it.
Ah so its kinda like a makefile? Cool, now I should have no problems setting er up 😄
Ah so kinda like a wrapper of sorts?
Ah, alr then, I will prob use DNS + ios hack then :) Could you maybe teach me how to setup domain records maybe later Spotlight? :)
Ah, File-Maker will function by itself then? Neat, that should work excellent while debugging I hope.
Ah, no worries then 🙂 (Also I have noticed, we will probably have to overwrite the charset, because JP charset in US doesn't work too well) Honestly, it's really not a problem, I've worked with BRFNT before, if that is what it used
Ah, so the Wii's CPU is sorta the sequel CPU, the successor of ppc750? Neat, I should document this on the wiki when I go on this week, that would be cool 😄
Ah, that's what causing it haha?
Ah, will do then 🙂
Ah.
Ah. Still a really funny toy though actually.

Aio*
All 5 of my VM's are finished Larsen, going to start encoding tommorow.
All done fluffy, come see over in my livestream ol buddy 😄
All I know about french Larsen is how to say cheese omelette.
All of us are doing hackintoshes atm, I am too. 😄
All unlocked savefile.
Along with playing GTA, hack the machine's PCB used to play it using those schematics I posted!
Alr :blobokhand:
Alr cool, I should be done soon and then I will have time to PR everything, including Canada news. I have just been very busy, but after getting Forecast deployed I will work on that 🙂
Alr excellent, I actually rerember exactly where I left it, I think we should run over the IOS patch too to hopefully help with wii no ma :) /var/share/var/keybase/0.bin
Alr good, in that sense though, I have obtained dumps of wii shop channel that you could modify for OSC. if you dont have em already, i could give them to you tuesday when I have some spare time on that day.
Alr guys, thinking of doing my own little cowfc server. One problem. dietpi hates node.js atm, time to go to Pi discord :/
Alr mkwii, you will be doing EVC polls then too 🙂
Alr saetta, you it is 🙂
Alr snoot, Im going to finish my domain padder 🙂 Then we begin.
Alr then one sec
Alr then one sec Ill post it here, its entirely legal believe it or not, Microsoft has a UUP server that's legal to use and this sorta wraps it. But it does it a LOT better too.
Alr then, best of luck with your game 😄
Alr then, enjoy your fixed phone then Voaly. 🙂
Alr then, hey Saetta wanted to ask ya: You got any Spanish or German translations as of lately? Ik a decent amount of those laungages.
Alr then, I might ask her. Also Hack2lose, is it ok if I DM ya? I really gotta show you my gecko code collection, mine's pretty big.
Alr then, I was just a bit worried, but eh I should be fine then. Speaking of which Larsen, could you maybe unblock me sometime? I'll be working on various wiinat and conntest and even some demae channel stuff so im pretty excited to get it done for rc24 community, Im going to try to see if doordash api will work for us 🤞
Alr then, no worries 🙂 Im going to put the first two repos of stuff over in my WiiLink24 github now, hopefully it goes well 🙂
Alr then, speaking of which Larsen, votes.py prompts me for the questions right?
Alr then, that will be fine. (last thing I will say, we are making a faster engine by porting it over to Go language, and we will PR to RC24 to allow them to have it too)
Alr voaly https://discordapp.com/channels/206934458954153984/258999527783137280/744343442808635403
Alr 🙂 Did it work well?
Alr 🙂 I wasnt criticzing, I was just curious 🙂 see everyone later
Alr, added the new one, will record it running for reference 🙂
Alr, Alpine it is 😄 Brb mates, gonna try to flash it to a SD
Alr, also as for that Golang port of your panel, never got around to it. I am practicing REST API's/MUX Api's/Routes in Go though, so it'll be somewhat easy.
Alr, but yeah this new feature is gonna be epic. 😄 See you in a few KcrPL, Ill leave the POC I made for it in your DM's.
Alr, gimme one moment, Ill package them up.
Alr, I will CTRL+C the script, one sec 🙂
Alr, I will increase RAM, reboot, and fix names 🙂
Alr, I will put that on the server just in case. By the way Larsen, Im going to implement Canada News RSS now, gimme about 5 mins for the base implementation?
Alr, I will tell you. Gimme one minute.
Alr, I will try 🙂 Meet me in VC, they will be looking through our github 🙂
Alr, no worries (just by 8:40 MST because Ill be going to bed really soon after that 😄 )
Alr, no worries then. 🙂 Hope you enjoy that devkit too, I have more web devkits coming very soon..
Alr, no worries 🙂 I will run the script again once that is done compiling, and then we should be good 🙂
Alr, one min 🙂
Alr, one sec
Alr, prob in a hour, im driving home rn :) actually my friend is driving haha :P
Alr, see you in four hours.
Alr, should be fun to setup then :) I think I need help though with the RSA patch, its my first time :)
Alr, will do 🙂 (What did you set the root user too btw?)
Alrighty then one sec
Also Dogmander, I made a cool link between cacti and your server, which I am nicknaming Akiza. Basically your server timekeeps, and Spotlight, your server recieves the current time.
Also here is a MP4 version.
Also I stinking love your pfp @Darkbones777 it looks so cool ❤️
Also I thought they used wav though, intriguing.
Also I wasnt calling you guys stupid, I was calling discord's servers that. One sec Ill try to post er again.
Also shopsdk is super close, I do want to hear any suggestions you might have before I finish it, as there is room for improvement.
Also snoot, I've been optimizing ShopSDK lately, it's a lot faster now.
Also snoot, that region DRM we were getting, did we manage to decompile it yet? I hope it's really not Metaforce, because like I stated, it is the worst DRM ever to crack (I hate metaforce)
Also urmum, have you installed nzlss in the past? Im having a problem.
Also, I figured out ACCF dlc 🙂
Also, I wanna do ACCF distributions, but slight problem: I dont know the domain you put them on?
Also, rendering stuff to that page is a WIP, I still need to do that part haha.
ALthough I am probably contradicting myself by saying that.
Although I currently only see this working really with WUS, as I dont know if there is a good system to deobsfucate the AAAAAAAA and AAAAAAB and all that jazz.
Although Larsen, sorry if I have been annoying lately, Ill try to be better I got some more wii schematic and devkit stuff up my sleeve, so Im hoping to get that released to ya on Monday.
Although my server is a Raspberry pi, so mine is a psychical server, his server dynamically serves code to my server.
Although one more thing Spotlight, what's Tronosphere? I tried to view the code but its gone
Although tbh, @GameBreaker64 Bootmii and Priiloader really are the only way 🙂
And dont just do something, stand there XD (That was a line from a old 19 century movie, you guys get the reference haha) But yes, strike the baby centurion, very roughly.
And everyone, I've been forgetting so... night everyone! Night urmum, night unowe, night baconz, night paniaal, night Light7, night dylan, night Larsen, night reely, night everyone! 😄
And here is everything pre-extracted.
And here is the src!
And I added access to all 5 of my email accounts Larsen 🙂 So that way I wont lose it (Hey larsen, if you dont mind me asking, how do you guys in RGD keep your data alive without having drives die? Im getting into collecting and I feel daunted a bit haha)
And I am going to make some of the data in those repos static, that way they will be more purely written in Go.
And I had the chance to help test! @KcrPL cheers Kcr, you and me and all the testers work paid off :huggies:
And I have a ISO + lots of keys for XP if you need fluffy, DM me if ya need anything.
And I know why!
And I learnt python around the same age as larsen I think. You look like a cool guy in that pic Redbees, speaking of which redbees I have a present for you tommorow. here is a preview.
And I think I know how to achieve it Larsen, if I get it done before ya do, I will send you the .git file under MIT license for ya 🙂
And I will do records as soon as I can? 😄
And Ill check, one sec
And its in python https://prnt.sc/u37u3e
And mine also has a different pronoucation, its not 6100 meters. Its actually pronounced gloom, my pfp will give ya a hint.
And not only that, Sega continued to. Ill show you a prime example, one moment please.
And nowhere on google, great.
And on the topic of archive.org larsen, you and me have a weird thing in common. We both like Baby einstein for some reason.
And re-install is done. https://prnt.sc/th8x5z
And Sega did that one too.
And snoot, I invited you as a collaboarator to my repo, and github.com/WiiLink24 organization 🙂
And snoot, should I do CGI or PHP mainly? Like, Im debating that and using Python vs. Perl for CGI scripts and whatnot.
And speaking of defines, I have been working on a JS redirection engine. Its really sexy, and it needs a lot of work still. Thats what those js files are for in my github.io repo I made.
And thanks Larsen, will do. One of the things I was thinking of a little lately was seeing if a auto-minifier is possible, which should be fun. At first, I thought of modding the entire code at once with having the entire code inside the script, but I think I can modify it per line iirc. (Or like, find and replace patch too, those are always fun)
And the fork 😛
And the Mii channel is purring lol
and wii.com
And with gecko os, holy gekko. @fluffy yo it even works with Gecko XD
And yeah, I told JG (the other guy) to do a cron job on his server 🙂
And yes, I tried to add you in a random way.
And yes, PNG/JPEG's can attack if they have exploits in them.
And yes, they have cable internet services now 😛
And yes.
Any version fluffy, actually how bout 20197.1000 will that do?
Anyhoo gtg guys, see ya all later 😄
Anyhoo guys, Ive got schoolwork. Ciao?
Anyhoo paniaal, you and me.. we good right?
Anyone coming tonight for stream? 😄
Anyone have DJ Role? We cant get it turned up to 70 for some reason.
anyone interested in me doing a MC server for RC24 discord?
Anyone wanna listen to forecast channel music over in Jenna roll? Should be fun 😄
Anyone wanna watch anime over in Jenna roll?
Anyone want to work on Wii no ma shop in glitch with me and snoot?
Anything I could help out with Dogmander and the guys? @Larsenv Also, I am going to look into that My aquarium filename thing, I know it's kinda pointless, but eh, the shop needs more merch and I can offer mystery tanks.
Anything I should note when installing Unbound snoot? :)
Anyway Larsen, I made ya something cool, you'll recongize some of these, from AwesomeMarioFan's thread. 🙂
Anyway Saetta, I'll let you test too actually, I only have 2-5 testers atm.
Anyway, bedtime for me, night Snoot and JG 🙂 And I will see you guys on monday, as sunday is my day for religious focus/family stuff, but yeah hopefully I can get ShopSDK unminified on monday.
Anyway, I added the source code, check commits 🙂
Anyway, installs are finished now, Im going to bed.
Apologizes guys, had a tummy ache and I have a cold, I have to step out for another min.
Apologizes, that file apparently wasn't the real one, some bad site spit that out. Sorry.
Arm is better guys, Im back in business!
Around 2-8PM, hope everyone enjoys it.
As for betterconnect24, im making it only so I can easliy modify it with oss components. I do realize however talking about it so much is clowning, yes, and I noticed my team was in chat history so I will make sure we do better in the future. No offense to either parties, of course.
As for birthday ideas, that was stuff I was showing to my mom for my birthday haha.
As for blocking, meh I am sorta being a little twerpish, end of conversation on that, lets get back to what we were talking about earlier, I dont wanna push it further.
As for Digicam and Wii No Ma shop DLC sending, can you get my sendgrid engine put in JG? It might also be cool to have food-server send food pics, also.
As for News channel Spotlight, it's getting closer, and as for jninja format strings, I could probably get those put into ShopSDK, I just need to figure out how to get those done.
As for that blender project RedBees, my GFX card crashes atm with Blender, Ill fix when I can 😉 And tbh yea, its not like a x86 where you can emulate it, its a sort of -- FPGA abomination thingy.
As for that, yes I was venting.
As for unzip, yeah I tend to forget. As for 2, wdym?
As for wii no ma, theoretically to fix the menu bug, we could do a custom charset, or brfnt for that matter.
As you can see, I was taking apart WARC dumps to analyze the server packets, to then try to figure out how they worked.
Ask Larsen
At least in #random it doesnt, I cant hear it haha.
Audio is broken however
Ay 🙂
Ay, it is 🙂
Ay, it stumped me a bit when I looked it up 😛
Ay, yep 🙂
Baconz is a cool man @jordiisepic respect the man who likes bacon, a glorious dish.
Based on the TIFF vuln by the guy who hacked the PSP for the first time.
Basically 100-200 M ohm is being fed to a ground signal to supplement it to not have voltage leak into it.
Basically Adam, it just FLAT out wont fit, at all 😛
Basically I can edit Windows executables and bend them to my will
Basically it takes four user inputs, the input file, the output file, the opcode (d for erase, e for append) and what you named gbalzss.exe 🙂
Be sure to decode that from base64, then view the link it gives you. You will have to go to that message, then the link in that message to actually get the base64 content.
Be sure to delete gloom/srv in merch-poc branch btw Snoot, I'll probably PR in a couple mins.
Because I am going to have some dummy coords mapped to Canada.
Because I AM on windows 7 lol.
Because I goofed haha. 😛
Because if it's metaforce, we are in for a lot of pain. Metaforce is very difficult and a complete nightmare to crack.
Because its a bulky little fella, but eh Hydro Thunder and Toy commander are fun to play on it.
Because of my parents 😛
Because of that, I kinda found out Dogmander's and Rocket's name by accident. Not to worry, I am going to be setting up a Roundcube server so we can mask our names.
Because the sun would burn you up in less than a picosecond.
Because theoretically the old one exists within the WAD right? @Snoot 🐾 If so, I'll use that, as I dont want to make one from stracth lol 😛
Because this can be achieved without JS actually! https://prnt.sc/um3bss
Because we dont need SSH for it.
Because 😛
bedtime for this pokemon, gn guys 😄
Best corruption 10/10 :mattclock: is appeased :3
Best part is: Docker-compose is working!
Best part is: I dont have to reverse WC24, I can just connect to RC24 through that software, which is nice to have, because I'll be able to connect to Wiimmfi as well through that DNS, and my other stuff
Best pic of Wii Sports Baseball e3 2006 out there, quality :blobkissheart:
Bit late on virus stream, will provide tonight. Ready on your end..? @sdhsako
Bit of a rare thing in my collection, I have a 500gb wd my book that is compatible with WiiMC.
Bluecore is a windows mod one of my friends did for a forum Im on, its one of the best ones on our forum. Nice and vanilla, and it's great for my purpose. (I cant tell you what forum in this chat as its piracy for me to do so lol)
Boo. Boo. Boo. Boo. Boo. Boo.
Boom, his wii's fixed.
brb guys, got some drivers to install.
brb guys, my family wants to play with smoke bombs lol
Brb mates, Imma eat breakfast sandwiches that ARENT from taco bell. (Taco bell is crap, my insestines swamp up whenever I eat taco bell 😛 )
Btw who's head am I standing on I wonder 🤔
But here is the tool, but it is slightly broken 😦
But I didnt really do anything to annoy you, you were just sorta mad at me ever since I temporaily left RGD.
But I will try though, one min
But its working now! 😄
But like, what argument does it want? 🤔
But yeah dogmander, Gigatron will be ready at 6:30PM MST
But yeah Larsen and dht, sorta wanted your thoughts on it as Im not sure which I should do tbh.
But yeah Larsen, I think I am missing something on that line 18? I have no clue what though.
But yeah, github doesnt index like that sadly.
But yeah, higher the lossless audio quality, the better imo
But yeah, I have a few things planned, basic stuff, canada news and bugfixes. I even have plans to make coord_decode a tool.
But yeah, I'm starting to learn Go, so that way I can write Go for wiilink24.
But yeah, Im going to crawl what I can with a custom DL List I am making + a wget.exe with a propeitary dumper! Wish me luck guys!
But yeah, internet filters and they might get after me. I might actually update that tonight, with the proper music.
But yeah, put it as the one alongside it (kinda like the forecast-logs channel's emote thing at the beginning)
But yeah, shopsdk is done, I am going to clean it up and it should be ready for Wii No Ma. Can routes have params passed to them I wonder?
But yeah, the server ``6100mifi-server.001.000webhostapp.com`` isnt one of nintendo servers, its my replica of conntest, sorry for the confusion haha. In any case, I will be trying out the local DNS RC24 software which should be fun, Imma add more sites to the config so that way I can still enjoy riiconnect24 while still being able to add in backed up websites however I like 😄
But yeah, what happened to Hack2lose, he still around?
But yes I will be plugging in a second monitor and getting it cleaned up, I promise haha.
Buy with your C code, win big! 😛
By the way Larsen, I made some more stuff out of Mariocube assets 🙂
cacti 🙂
Can anyone invite me to the Wii No Ma dev server over DM's?
Can I be it saetta? I am decent with coding. 😄
Can I go worse?
Can I have it? 😄
Can I help guys?
Can someone ask one of the mods to have a talk with yoshi?
Can we limit its usage maybe?
Can you send me it Rocket? I'll try to utilize it as a example/base.
Can't we just co-exist? Tbh I give up trying.
Cant find the midi, its missing (which I think I have it locally, Im not sure)
CatBees 😄
Centurylink is worse :/
Chat's a little quieter than normal.
Ciao buddies 😄
Ciao guys, I got server stuff to do + get my arm situation fixed. (Luckily in my dev server, two of my devs are taking my place for the next two days which is good)
ciao mates, I will see everyone later 🙂 have fun ugh, unowe, and voaly
Coded in HTML, jquery, css, and js
Cold in my house atm ironically, feeling a little better about the whole event last night. Like Im shivering a lot 😛
Come on over mates, it'll be fun 😄
Comic sans ma 😛
Consider it pikacdn v2
Cool how they output in Mii files, Mii installer should very well be compatible.
Cool little emote actually, I like CMOC 🙂
Cool, huh JG? 🙂 Also, I gotta run JG, but hopefully this works 🙂
Correct. Gateway was the first too, and gateway actually made the exploit that made Pasta work. The mset exploit, if you will.
Could you maybe ask Larsen to unblock me as well? I got some questions to ask him, particualry Syscheck and Wii DLC, I have many questions about those two particularly :)
Couple things real quick before I fall asleep:
Crazy thing I've never told anyone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS3Lkc6Gzlk My dad used to sing this to me everynight when I was little, its very special to me.
Crossing my fingers about your patch TMinus :) Youll be around at 5-6 PM mst right spotlight? Just in case, I might need your help later :)
Cuteness overload :3
D is for dodo
Daisy-chaining them, easy.
Dammit I was so close! 😄
Dammit, you beat me, nvm 😛
Dang, well, hopefully we can decompile it then.
Dangit, we will have to make one from stracth then. Did you make any progress on the index.esf file JG?
DDR is sanic
Dear Larsen,
Demae Channel.
dht, why is there a win exe for it? Im just curious. 😄
Did it just compress it... AUGGGHHHH time to compress/send it a third time, good lord.
Did some go code today Spotlight, a route engine 🙂 How'd I do?
Did that every time, guess Internet was bad for me back then.
dir /b /s /a returns every file in that folder, and that's what this log is 🙂
Dir dump of nwcs, wonder which is My aquarium? I know which one is animal crossing, but I dont know where the rest is.
DM`d. Yeah, that ISO is bootleg, the version I sent you is a LOT more stable.
Do base64, that would emphasize the joke.
Do it Larsen, and get us a better VPS (I plan to do a cfh mirror if it helps free up load, it will be hosted via my domain name + self-hosted DDNS)
DO THE MARIO :mattclock:
Do you have glitch.me zurgeg? 🙂
Do-do-do-do!
Do-do-do-do!
Does thiojoe even know its christmas? Does thiojoe even know its christmas? Does thiojoe even know its christmas? Or is he a confused disembodied fish?
Doesnt larsen have a cat too speaking of which?
Dogmander, should I do a evc theme, news theme, or forecast theme for Gigatron? Also, should I incl. my TIFF exploit or my 3ds exploit as a bonus utility?
Doing excellent, I am very excited for v2.5 of my 0day. (all bugfixes, some other stuff I wont say the name of for debugging, and on top of all that, it will be able to do pwning even better. 😉  ) I also have been playing with Altium, my favorite toy. 😄
Dont mind me then lol
Dont worry, hosting is free! 000webhost.com
dot xcf
Download the 010, 012, and 014 file to obtain the remaining space.
DPG is a nintendo ds movie 😄
drat, stupid enter button lol

Eh a few reasons I sorta want to try my hand at it, one being if rc24 gets taken down, Ill still be able to use it, and second I wanna compliement my portable wii project with its own wc24 server too 😄
Eh alr, I might see if I can get dwc that optimized (Hoping you might have a benchmark on that maybe?)
Eh because my wii portable isnt done yet, and I want anime on the go
Eh everyone is attacking me a bit, Larsen and tron are.
Eh fair enough yes, luckily I actually have been learning Python lately, and I can do really small code (I can minify it in ways you wouldnt believe, literally I can minify nearly every single text variable or defined text which is neat) 😄
Eh good point yea, also speaking of which I never really saw why people hate SSQE01, I liked the system of riding on a little car.
Eh good point, I sorta liked it because it would be a nice little toy for debug stuff.
Eh I can do encodes pretty good, I've been studying them quite a bit lately.
Eh I could donate my Mii Ig, I could try to recreate mine in Mii Editor (swf)
Eh I gtg anyway paniaal, but I will see you later! Good job on your project, I hope to help you develop at some point! Ciao paniaal ol' friend!
Eh I just wasnt certain if it came out yet, nvm 😄
Eh I might post it on my yt channel then prob.
Eh I usually get bored and come up with random ideas haha, and yeah I always just wanna help, that and the fact I get to be in the credits too
Eh I was just wondering if you guys needed it, but since we are using ffmpeg, never mind. 😄
Eh Idk. Hey larsen, I have one pic you'll like on my CDN. Gimme one minute
Eh if it helps, I can really host any of em if it helps free up load, since we are so tight on load.
Eh Ill be giving him those server backups of the previously mentioned sites so he can put it on his server. 😄
Eh Ill look at sudomemo in the mornin
Eh it's just stuff like mii's falling through the ratings boxes and stuff, just small stuff I kinda wanna work out 🙂
Eh its fun http://prntscr.com/tbi4hs Well I stockpiled a lot of tools for various Windows executable editing
Eh its just because having a talking script is cool imo, nvm then
Eh Ive heard your voice before rerember? When that good voice guy was doing that thing?
Eh just for funsies.
Eh no worries then fluffy, perhaps though we could make a AI core out of it? That would be cool.
Eh no worries then 😄
Eh no worries, but yeah, I'm going to see if I can convert all the Pokemon cooking vids for you and Larsen.
Eh that, and we are ALREADY distributing stuff so might as well have it public
Eh then, I might as well give her a try next week Larsen, that and I might FINALLY have a replacement for 8.8.8.8 for a small research project of mine for RC24, thinking either the whole thing is put into that DNS, or it just notifies users when they connect to it that servers are offline. Either way, it should be fun I think.
Eh they started barking and chasing me to my basement, rather loudly. (I think my big dog is getting aggressive a bit)
Eh this one actually works well, at least I dont struggle to find drivers, or HWID's for that matter
Eh to be honest yea, at this point: I think its better if I just block Larsen, and I forget. As for why, its more of because I can modify it, that and I can have it permeneatly on my portables too.
Eh wondershare broke on windows 8 for me + none of my software worked so yea, I kept it for like 2 months personally
Eh yea, you cant beat ffmpeg. 😎
Eh yeah agreed. (I really like that banner music though, it's really cool because it reminds me what the channel is, you know what I mean?)
Eh yeah there are some other good ones too
Eh yeah, nvm then, was just wonderin
Eh you have a point urmum, I always preffered feature-packed software personally. And as for that Wii Remote Plus thing, I've actually had that problem in the past, I think it was with DOP-Mii when I temporaily downgraded to 4.1
Eh you have a point.
Eh, alr 🙂 Any job that needs done Larsen? I have a bit of free time. 🙂
Eh, because I dont have a excellent server atm.
Eh, because I want to make my community stable before I start bringing new features to File-Maker.
Eh, I can get my gogs server going, gimme about 10 mins??
Eh, I have Advanced BAT To Exe converter and I like using it 🙂
Eh, I hope to set aside my differences with Larsen.. someday..
Eh, I just need a secondary CDN for cfh/conntest
Eh, I like to flex 🙂
Eh, I was just wondering if you knew.
Eh, I was on a chromebook and I havent uploaded Forecast yet, but eh, I didnt really have much goodies and there was a lot of unused space. So I was like, meh, why not 😛
Eh, I will be revising it over time 🙂
Eh, Ill prob do that yea.
Eh, Im kinda using everything I can grab 🙂
Eh, Im trying to be done with my Wii Portable work by the end of 2021, I do have a deadline to try to get my wii portable done haha. And since I want to have wc24 stuff on it at launch, Im trying to get it done as soon as I can 🙂
Eh, in case my devs are asleep.
Eh, it makes it a bit dynamic. I will be cleaning it up however.
Eh, its because I can. (That, and I have a CDN anyway, so might as well use it.)
Eh, its fun 🙂
Eh, its more of a way so that way we can dynamically write stuff from a JS file, without the indivuality of HTML files.
Eh, its sorta because I want to do limited SSH access and I want people to be able to edit scripts without needing to connect to my server.
Eh, its to allow that to host properly (since File-Maker needs Sentry and all)
Eh, Ive been trying to alternate between my usual one.
Eh, just if ya want. 🙂
Eh, lay out the base and get ready to get a real implementation. One moment though Larsen, I have the RSS list on hand, I left it in me and fluffy's DMs.
Eh, tbh yea 🙂
Eh, the same codebase gets used in each channel, so that tells it which mode it should go to so it wont get confused. (For instance Forecast Channel is 0, and EVC is 1 iirc)
Eh, to wrap those servers into their domains.
Eh, we actually will have multiple servers.
Eh, we use it because of simplicity, we will be moving to other hosts in the future. Ciao mates, Imma go shower.
Ehhh ok 🙂
Endless is a dead bot atm. Watch, it doesnt play a thing.
Espically when I am demoing on VC..
Evc is fine, I need snoot to hook normatim to new however.
Evem still they did some stuff for Nintendo, iirc it was mainly making games for various things.
Even namco got in on the e3 shit. One sec ill show you.
Every time I miss the chance to grab it :/
Everybody Votes Channel File Generator
Everyone asleep?? 😛
Exactly like that.
Exactly that fluffy, yea 😄
Exactly that.
Exactly yea. @Shraqil My only problem with this community is that, and the fights needs to stop entirely.
Exactly, I even made fan art for you Artuto my dude. :mattclock:
Exactly, it does.
Excellent fluffy, we should make a Ubuntu server out of that baby, it might be good for it too (Not to mention the fact that we can distribute Wii roms on the fly by dumping them and saving them to the server itself)
Excellent then sd, we will shoot for 8PM.
Excellent then, speaking of which Larsen a way I used to make slideshows was I would put my photos into AVS converter, and it would come out the other end as a slideshow video.
Excellent 🙂 Speaking of which voaly, I think I figured out how to go about the NWFC servers. A wiimmfi/6100mifi switch homebrew should do the trick I think. (Perhaps having a EMUNAND hooked up to that homebrew should help a bit too)
Excellent, and we could use that dedicated IP to route the rest as well 🙂
Excellent, could you maybe decompile it so I can inject ShopSDK's POST requests into it?
Excellent, hope to see ya then 😉
Excellent, hopefully we can get Cornier brought over, as he has already done some work in the past.
Excellent, I will see you then Baconz, ciao (We will do it over DM's if that's alright with you) 😄
Excellent, the more servers the better our capabilities are 🙂
Fair enough, not sure if you're being sarcastic tron. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here, being the forgiving man Im trying to be.
Fair point urmum, I just sorta thought it was cool that you could.
Farming simulator -- I mean other people disagree, but I dont mind the game (I like a lot of games, I dont really give in to criticsm)
Fellow Hacker: What did you do today 6100m?
Filezilla and Putty both fail at auth 🤔
Fine I admit, I have one 😛
Fine lol, Ill boot up a repl.it VM, gimme the encrypted one and I will do it 🙂
Fine, I will post the source code then, one min 🙂
Fine, that's fair..?
First attempt at C++ ***I still have this?!***
Fixed, that should do it I think?
Fixed, yay! 😄
Fixed. https://6100mifi-server-001.000webhostapp.com/cdn/html5.html
fluffy, can you and me talk over Dm's about it?
For instance, Voaly's SSBB friend code. Im hoping that friend codes like that port over.
For mkw*
For the life of me, why wont my port connect 🤦‍♂️
For the mobiclip tools 🙂 Its in Larsen's SDK repository 🙂
For those of you who want to read more, I highly suggest this vid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImR-TdDAIJE
Fun fact: The DS is techincally a AGS-001.
Funny story, I actually tried to use WC24Decrypt to decrypt first.bin, and it came out as garbage data haha. I learnt to not assume it was.
Funny you mention that, I had a win7 dark edition at one point.
g is for george
Gigatron generates data based on this entered data.
Gimme a min, Ill get it hosted.
Gimme one min alr?
Gimme one min Baconz, Ill DM you a much better version
github*
github.com/WiiLink24/File-Maker it basically executes votes.py from this to allow @Mkwii64 to run it from a discord bot. @Link
gloom-server-0.ga
gn dht 😄
Go to sleep urmum, my frendo
Going to get ShopSDK cleaned up too, and maybe get the web panel on Go routes. Lots of ideas I have 🙂
Going to wait about a couple mins for people to get here
Good god though, it doesnt work as well as I rerember it working 😅
Good minds think alike then paniaal, eh?
Good, funny enough I had to localhost a Pi for Cacti access back when I had access, because SSH would act up on my end. I think that was because I was forwarding it at the same time 🤔
Good, I just need to work out if q and n args stay the same, or they need to have question data 🙂
Good, which files contains all the URLS you found? Imma run them through my link extractor.
Goooooddd afternoon RC24, how are we today?
Grabbing a Win7 VM and a WinXP VM to do all this.
Great, now my pic is missing 😛
Gtg guys brb
Gtg mates, see you guys tommorow afternoon (or morning 😄 )
gtg mtes
Gtg though mates, I got some schoolwork.
Guys, please....
Guys... it happened. (6-11 hour movie test in 2 days)
h is for harry, i is for iglooamus. (actually, what was I trying to say?)
h:names
Happy birthday, happy happy birthday! Hey!
Have headache, must install Dietpi even if it hurts me.
Havent tested it but some scripts should work
Havent yet, will do right after I get this CDN uploaded. 😄
Havent, I havent the foggiest what's happenin
He did, and that's what we have been using, as my Pi isn't that great, so thanks to him we should be good I think. 🙂
He had it on pokeacer.xyz, and I stumbled on it basically.
He has been lately with our project 🙂 Arturo, not so much 😛
He hasn't yet, but we got forecast working 🙂
He means fix the embed basically.
He seems to be a friendly guy, amazing to meet him finally!
He sounds like one of those guys who is talking about nature, like in a nature moves when a seagull is about to pounce on a turtle or something.
He was the main brain behind RC24, all the server scanning was done by him.
Heart dropped a bit last night, disc for Deadlyfoez didnt work 😦 Not sure exactly what even happened.
Heck yeah, and thanks to my working port-forwarding, server stuff is a lot less painful for me now.
Heck, I even have a Altium schematic detailing it.
Heck, I even use it for tech support related stuff when helping friends, it helps me to help them get drivers easily without much pain. (I hate finding HWID's manually :/ )
Heck, they should make a game about RC24 actually (Didnt we already make a game?)
Heh, I meant a minute 😛
Heh, our server autheincation is wack atm.
Heh. that just barely appeared in my recommended this morning haha.
Hehe, its almost 9:30 so I am a bit drowsy haha.
Hehe, you're not the first person to say that. Well, Im named after the pokemon gloom, because originally when I created this account, I had depression and gloom became my spirit animal ever since.
Hell, I can use it as my senior project a bit too haha.
Hello :squirtle_wave: 🙂
Hello dht! 🙂 I have awoken from my slumber.

Hey /dev/urandom, you wanna see something cool?
Hey @fluffy we are doing the 0day in jenna roll
Hey @GamerKGR come over to Jenna roll, we are doing corruptions with tons of WAD's (once they finish downloads)
Hey @KcrPL KcrPL, I got something cool to show you in DM's. You are going to LOVE the cool feature I have planned for your RC24 scripts.
Hey @urmum_69 , sorry for ping but https://prnt.sc/uo1miu I can still use my sentry account instead of a self-hosted server right?
Hey @zjtech123 , I slept like a baby last night, without my melatonin. Had some strongoff for breakfast too. Anyway, I am ready for the day, so can we meet up in dev vc? Thanks to Joel, I got some Wii No Ma shows that I can encode.
Hey arturo, could I talk with you over DM's for a while? There's a few things I wanted to talk about with you privately, just stuff on my mind + ideas I had for RC24 stuff
Hey artuto, would you happen to know about key_path in file-maker? Wondering where I get the key. (Going to be doing canada news maybe later today, I might as well have a decent testing setup)
Hey baconz, as promised I SHOULD have a test ready tonight, when that reminder goes off Ill give you the stuff to test.
Hey baconz, I DM'd ya.
Hey baconz, I have something to show you.
Hey baconz, you free tommorow? I'll have something cool for you to beta-test, its a suprise 0.o
Hey baconz, you wanna try it out too buddy 😄 I can link to it.
Hey burrito, you ever tried Archbang? It's a really fun OS. 🙂 I'll be using it to access Cacti, when I do get back to developing on that server that is.
Hey citrus and burrito, you guys up for a glitch.me coding session to work on Wii No Ma shop too?
Hey dht, can you hop into VC for just a min? Something is broken.
Hey dht, do you know CGI scripts well? I have a question 🙂
Hey dht, I had a weird idea for the Wii mail database, you wanna hear it? 😄
Hey dht, you should try HAProxy, it's great for domains. 🙂
Hey dogmander, Im going to revise the CDN pack.
Hey fluffy you still watchin general buddy? Wanna show you the final product 😄
Hey fluffy, what was your pfp modeled after? (I saw the hoit video, I was just wondering what that little toy was)
Hey fluffy, you wanna see? 🙂
Hey fluffy.. oh boy, you havent seen my windows ISO downloader 😎 One sec, Ill show you.
Hey guys, does anyone know where I can contact Spotlight? I have something to ask em about Wii Mail.
Hey JG, did my videos add good? 🙂
Hey jordan, could you and me talk over DM's for a bit?
Hey jordan, ready to see a page that's twice as ambitious as my EVC one?
Hey jordan, you wanna see my github host? 🙂
Hey josh, would php be a better hook for Demae's Doordash api that I'll do, or should I try swf or cgi?
Hey keego, can we voice call eqch other this afternoon? I got a early christmas present for ya, a asset pack so sexy, I guarantee you will love it.
Hey larsen,  for the sentry path in File-Maker, do I just put the domain I host sentry on
Hey larsen, did you hear about the possible NUS shutdown with eshop closure? Im thinking of doing a DNS loaded with the NUS prob.
Hey larsen, do you think Sierra or Mojave is better? Going to maybe do a install tonight or on monday I think.
Hey larsen, does votes.py, when I specify the args you told me, does it ask for them or do I put it in place of the args?
Hey larsen, gonna try out the Local DNS software on the RC24 github, to add some other DNS redirections I want while still being able to connect to the RC24 offical servers and not have to switch DNS's. I am gonna try to dump some *.wii.com domains and see if I can get it working with it. 😄
Hey larsen, how does this look for canada news?
Hey larsen, I did something fun with forecast.py. I made it send log files to owncloud instead of Datadog as I dont have datadog. 🙂 Although Larsen, theoretically you can encrypt anything such as text to lz? It was a weird thought that I had.
Hey larsen, I gave your mariocube assets some love, wanna see what I made?
Hey Larsen, I modified your coord checker to be 128 bytes, and I gave it the name ``fore128``
Hey larsen, I recorded the whole stream for a RC24 vid.
Hey Larsen, Im going to be making a USB-Gecko. https://www.gc-forever.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3089
Hey larsen, Im making my SDK VM 🙂 I'm even making two Linux VM's too, for some misc stuff, and a Win7 for downloading stuff/misc stuff.
Hey larsen, on votes.py, it says setup_log doesnt exist? I installed all dependcies :ChatotThink:
Hey larsen, quick thing I wanted to tell ya, I found Canada News RSS sources, they are best in class!
Hey larsen, remind me, how did PokeAcer find em again?
Hey larsen, setup_log doesnt import on votes.py, it says its missing?
Hey larsen, should I increase my RAM to 13.5GB or keep it at 12GB for my encoding load?
Hey larsen, so I had an idea for the RiiConnect24 installer script. Turns out you can actually make scripts talk, I made a POC for you to show it off.
Hey larsen, that stuff you mentioned, the wc24 stuff, its all on wayback machine right?
Hey larsen, this one is weird
Hey larsen, you use NWC24MessageBoxEditor.exe for stuff right? 🙂
Hey larsen, you wanna see something even cooler than the mod version of addicti?
Hey larsen, you wanna see the worst Mario game ever?
Hey mkwii64, that reminds me, I hope to share some MKW stuff in your server tommorow, Im seeing if I can dig up my old anti-freeze stuff.
Hey not actually hack2lose, are you nohack2win persay? Just wondering, I used to watch that yt channel all the time.
Hey np 😄 But yeah, Im going to teach him about each one of those sites I mentioned, beginning to finish. Or as best as I can. I gtg mates, but see you guys in hopefully a little while.
Hey sdhsako, can you come to jenna roll for a bit? Thinking of testing before tonight.
Hey snoot, could you maybe get the IOS patched and upload the WAD maybe? I mean, wii no ma might have rsa verification so just in case :)
Hey snoot, I added some tools to the repo to help 🙂 https://github.com/WiiLink24/wiinomatool/tree/main/DebugTools
Hey snoot, so funny thing, I wrote a static file generator in Go, https://github.com/GloomConnect24/ACDLCPicker and because python was in previous commits, https://prnt.sc/vxov3n it literally says this. LOL, I deleted the python file half an hour ago and it still does this XD
Hey snoot, what does your datacenter look like anyway? I'm just kinda curious to see what cacti looks like 🙂
Hey snoot, you run sierra right? Debating whether to hackintosh sierra or mojave
Hey speaking of which Dark, will you be online at around 6-8PM Mst? I have something glorious for you to beta-test ol buddy.
Hey speaking of which Larsen, that reminds me. What is wiiarcade and wiiplayable?
Hey speaking of which Larsen, will File-Maker work with MariaDB good?
Hey spotlight, can we have a panel for forecast and news too maybe?
Hey spotlight, I wrote shopsdk in micropython now 🙂 https://github.com/6100m/room-server-1/blob/v4/gloom/shopsdk.py
Hey spotlight, is it ok if I mirror Wii Room WAD on my server so I can transfer it to my phone?
Hey though guys, before I go, anyone interested in my CoWFC server that i will be creating soon? 😄
Hey unowe and Voaly, you guys wanna see something cool?
Hey unowe, are you able to (like the moderator role has DJ right?) Trying to listen to katamari music. 😛
Hey unowe, can you teach me to do a domain too? 🙂
Hey unowe, you wanna see a page that I hosted on my old hosting?
Hey urmum, could you review my little mod of forecast.py later?
Hey urmum, sorry if I am annoying, its just that I am usually weird/autisitc so yeah. Anyhoo, nice to meet you tho.
Hey urmum, thanks for taking a look on my port-forwarding, guess how I fixed it? Turns out: it wasnt broken at all, I just misunderstood how public IP's arent accessible internally.
Hey urmum, we made progress on Wii No ma 🙂 https://github.com/WiiLink24/wiinomatool
Hey voaly, got a gift for you.
Hey voaly, sorry if i was a bit annoying in VC, I got a bit excited about my project haha.
Hey voaly, you wanna see something cool?
Hey voaly, your SSBB FC (Im using that as a example here, bear with me) That is seperate from your Wii mail FC, correct?
Hey, at least you didnt have 1/4 of that like I did when I was a kid, I barely ever got to play online because there could only be one person on my internet at a time lol ;p
Hey, it worked! 😄
Hey, there we go.
Heyo dht, how goes it?
Heyo inoxi, from the other side. 😄
Heyo Jord, you wanna see a REALLY sexy web project of mine?
Heyo spotlight 😄
Hi Snappy! 🙂
Hit view source to see what I mean, this will be used for the BC24 site, sorta as a tech demo.
Hold on a min, what happened for 3 hours..?
Hold on a minute, 5-49... WTFFFF
Holy frick guys, port forwarding is working now! I misunderstood, you can access it outside still, just not inside with external IP.
Honestly, I agree 🙂
Honestly, I cant decide, so maybe we will make it personalizable?
Hooray guys, my XP install is almost done https://prnt.sc/vuoi1g
Hopefully those tools help Snoot, I spent a lot of time making em 🙂
How bout that nick?
How bout this one? Thats my mii 😄
How did you even get it on android without vff :Kappa:
How did you sleep LMG07? I couldnt sleep last night, was so excited for my releases later today. I got nunchuck schematics, n64 console,
How do I look mates? Like my nick?
How do you patch the domains in the wad then I wonder :ChatotThink:
How fast was I guys? :poggers:
HOWWWW?!!?! That has to be edited.

Huh alr, one min 🙂
Huh cool, I can perhaps help with it dht, Im really skilled with things like that (one of my other skills is modifiying Windows PE Executables!) 😄
Huh cool, I need to try that when I try out File-Maker, Ill try to get as many miis as possible 🙂
Huh cool. @monado2 ||Yeah, you could make pronouns like ikea sagoskatt dinosaur, monkey, Arceus. 😛 ||
Huh odd, I actually uploaded the wrong one. One min, Ill post the real one, that one I think was a patched version I did of yours to route to domains. One min 🙂
Huh, is it patchable I wonder? 🤔
Huh, not sure whats happening with it, @sdhsako can you fix it maybe?
Huh, something else must be doing it.
huh?
I --- yeah ok Samus. :Kappa:
I abuse AI more, mwhaaaaa!
I achieved executing a JS file from a URL within a JS file.
I actually cant rn, @Snoot 🐾 Could you maybe run a quick test? 🙂
I actually dont know sadly
I actually have a fear of bees: despite never getting stung.
I actually started hacking around that era, all started with a lap finish quick code. From that point on, I began to do more, from pwning FTW (as a wannabe) to a intermediate hacker. Great meeting ya both too, can you maybe introduce me to him and his buddies sometime maybe?
I actually still use this toolpack, just not as much as I used to.
I actually wondered why Larsen put that one in his guide, Ig it's because he likes lightweight stuff?
I added my extractor for it too 🙂
I agree tbh. I might check the original config also, to see if I deleted anything
I agree urmum yes.
I agree, and I am talking to them about it 🙂
I always wondered 🙂
I am actually tempted to save that video to my flash drive and watch it on my Pi tablet on the go. 😄
I am going to be studying NWCS today 😎
I am prob wrong however tho.
I am watching your stream Larsen 🙂
I am willing to bet a 1000 he's 6.
I am??
I assume a kaitai file should help, if we can create one 🙂
I believe so yeah, I'm hoping to learn Go from DC24's code, and get better over time. I should prob bring MrIron over here, since he worked with ya on it.
I believe so.
I blocked yoshi guys :3
I call the pikachu btw! 😄
I can actually tell you with confidence there @Victor , gimme one min, I will grab my database I have
I can agree with that lol.
I can at least however code a small POC to show off the TTS functionality, I cant code much because of my arm haha.
I can be annoying...... but I dont find you a piece of crap, I find you cool. But I do have plans to actually make the patcher talk.
I can do Spock with both hands.
I can find the location maybe, one sec.
I can give you my packet dumping stuff though if it helps.
I can grab you a geckocode maybe Larsen, gimme one min.
I can help too by giving you a NAND Kcr, and a ExamDiff key if you want it too.
I can never spell it haha.
I can post the dump of it tonight if you guys want 😄
I can probably do it maybe.
I can provide the source, one moment 🙂
I can show you how that works if you want.
I can still go worser!
I can tell that's a blue clue's paradoy, I rerember the actual actor's face vividly 😄 That and the stinking song is stuck in my head endlessly.
I can type decently fast too. Time me to type 30 letters.
I cant clean it up till I move my desk + I get my Dell 1907FP plugged back in, its so painful to do with this setup because I snap my back each time.
I cant even SSH into my Pi since I have two routers :/
I could find a decent software for it urmum, if the one I find is cracked however, I will do it in DM's. There is a few that make decent slideshows that I know of.
I could give you a a hand with that LMG, PKG hacking is my speciality.
I could probably automate it via a shell script, to auto encode them to it. The other problem is the Kirby TV channel vids are gone off of youtube.
I could try 🙂
I deleted it, and wont do it again, sry.
I did it in 5 commits 🙂
I did that with a SimAnimals disc with my HP drive (which I still have in my PC right now actually) and rawdump killed it. :Jebaited:
I did that, and it still says the same?
I did too, I've been around for forever.
I did, I had the chance to meet him. He is really kind actually, and he really knows his stuff with WiiConnect24, when I was struggling he knew how to fix it. (Yeah, I guess I sorta see him and you as mentors)
I did, one sec 🙂
I did, yeah. No worries then 🙂 Hey speaking of which Larsen, I was trying to get nzlss installed... and I got this.
I did, yep 😄
I didnt know what I was saying, but seriously that was hurtful from Larsen..
I disagree tho Reader. I like mario party 8
I do actually, meet me in VC :sunglasses_pika:
I do as well 🙂
I do not.
I do plan to do something with it, primarily for a decent testing rig of just stuff I add to the repos 🙂
I do yeah, and im not really doing it in spite, Im more of doing it because eh, its fun to learn it, that and I can at least have a reason to do these new features for R(B)C24, as for Spotlight, me too 🙂
I do, its a habit hehe.
I do.
I dont currently, but I will be getting a job. https://6100m.github.io/techdemo/8/ should update itself with proper music in a min or two Larsen 🙂
I dont knoe if thats a good idea lol keego, what with covid and all. ;p
I dont know Tron, but they are!
I dont know what to name it, first person who says ``000`` gets the file named after them.
I dont, but i wanna hug this USB-Gecko clone I found :3
I dont, I think it doesnt do it sadly, but it might though 🙂
I dont? Ok guys, the role thing isnt funny. Anyhoo, night everyone, Im going to bed. (And I said gn to you too painaal) 😄
I dusted off the old mariocube assets, and gave em some love 🙂
I even wrote a PSOne Automatic codesigner, which required me to enter in 50 inputs and then it would complete the action based on what I did. This actually set the scene for multiple of my recent tools, incl. RAAEBOT, the one I shared with you all today.
I figured as much, it runs now? 🙂 Also, I found a schema for EVC 🙂
I forget who owns it haha
I forgot I didnt want my intestines to smell like a fecking swamp 😛
I forgot something when i just ate taco bell...
I found 62.
I found a playlist of all 150 episodes Spotlight, would it help if I scraped them?
I frigging love those wiitags, such great games ❤️
I gave myself a new status Dylan, inspired by yours. (I was bored and felt like it)
I got a little gift for em. Something I should've have given them before, but I goofed.
I got both t-shirts and posters implemented thanks to Printify (I should show it to you sometime) As for that, I never have but I think  SWF Image Creator and swftools are pretty good 😄
I got rid of datadog, revamped webhooks, and did 12 mins which broke it lol
I got Visual Studio now Snoot, you use that or atom? Whichever one, I will use the most 🙂
I grew up on them 🙂 They are a special place in my heart 🙂
I gtg mates, but I will see you all tommorow. Lets hope Forecast install works this time 🤞 It should though, its pretty much guaranteed! Ive fixed and prepared for each and every error, and it should work great 🙂
I had a bit too much fun to be honest with you urmum, but hey, how does it look? 🙂
I had macaroni, any pasta lovers in the house?
I had schoolwork sadly, what happened? 🙂
I have 5 VM's for WiiLink24 development, and I will post screenshots of them all.
I have a bandicam copy if you want it Redbees. 😄
I have a better pic though, one sec
I have a cdn as well (thanks to Hxper) https://auroras.tk/gloom
I have a dreamcast homebrew backup, still in my google drive to this day actually.
I have a DSI to test as well JG, but it'll be a day or two before I can get it setup for testing.
I have a friend who shiny-hunted with his XenoPhobia rom, he sent me his savefiles for me to play with.
I have a i7, one of the medium-end ones I think. But yeah, Intel GFX, I have never used them other than my minitower which came with it, Im on my gaming pc which has always had ati basically
I have around 1.5-2
I have been studying that very DRM @urmum_69 it exists in Steam, but its GOD DAMN weak drm.
I have IDA Pro 7.2 crack if you need Spotlight 🙂
I have just been busy, thats all. Speaking of which Larsen, I bounced for about a hour last night, because I got really excited about something.
I have managed to do a few things, such as get a base implementation put into Rii No Ma. As for why I am using docker, I am setting up sentry.
I have one also that I'd like to add.
I have plans to implement FLAC Banner playback on the site, star this if interested. If we can get five, ill go for it
I have several terabytes, yeah that's not happening. (Now if you want some of my E3 video stuff, I will give you that)
I have so many recreations of that engine, It isn't even funny lol 😛
I have some documentation left over from a few of them, one min 🙂
I have succesfully written a entire, fully-featured HTML page without using HTML! Only two lines of HTML tags, the rest is javascript! Anyway, I have a another important thing I wanted to ask Larsen. What is the best food API in your opinion? GrubHub's API looks to be under lock and key :/
I have the latest.
I have the logs of youtube connections from the wii, one sec
I have to go afk. (Look above btw)
I have yea, but my beagle is fine, yet my Border Sheperd seems to be flipping out a lot.
I havent the foggiest Saetta, they just hate me
I hoard youtube videos sometimes, but just for offline usage though.
I hope I dont fall asleep in VC X0
I jinxed it lol, sry XD
I just did, and yeah I agree 🙂
I just want to co-exist. I actually fought a little to get into this server, after a Discord error. Can everyone please just let me be, this is actually really getting hurtful.
I just wanted a reason to tell ya something cool 😛
I just wont say the name of the full domain, because, copyrights and I am uncertain if Larsen allows it to be said out loud. No worries though :huggies:
I kid haha, I'm just being a goof.
I kid, I kid, I usually just say that at times, that's usually how I talk.
I kinda agree snoot, yeah Im still learning python and Im kinda learning from your guys’s work atm. I do want to apologize if things have been a mess also. Anyway snoot... I have a christmas present for ya, wait till christmas day.. 🙂 It is a insane dvdiso filled to the brim with nintendo/wc24 stuff. As for the projects I was finishing for ya, havent been able to work on it much, but I am making a couple api’s for the us services. Including a custom geocoder that stores 50k cities in sql. Lot has happened tbh. @Snoot 🐾 One more thing Snoot, I have a plan for the us release. Ill make the patcher and have you fork it to the wl24 github. I even came up with a p2p wad downloading method using Irc instead of nus, as eshop is dying.
I knew that because IBM was talking like the chip wasnt specific to the gamecube, but was a OTS part.
I knew we were going to get some good corruptions with these. 😄
I know decent Python, never tried Perl. I also am good in Javascript, and beginner in PHP/CGI 🙂
I know the flags by heart, but I dont know THAT one.
I left the original names in the README on the ones I didnt modify 🙂
I like batch, bash, python, and C
I like d2x personally (that and I have just overall learnt to use it)
I like how it just randomly brings up being hungry this week. :laugh:
I like mine.
I like no$gba :3
I like that idea, (I hope you'll show off my Shopsdk code 🙂 )
I like that site Larsen, because it could access CMOC servers.
I like that too haha. Also, as for video ideas, I'm thinking, ofc, maybe some longplays?
I like the song because funny enough I actually somewhat dance to it a bit 🙂
I liked the DHT 3/4 because of just how weird of a dev system it is. Like, Ig it was meant to be like the IS-NITRO-CAPTURE sorta thing of gamecube? (Except a whole darn PC like SGI Indy)
I made a handful of windows tools to do it.
I made a NAND of both channels actually, was a gift for Burrito.
I made it on the very first day of this year 1/1/2020
I mean burrito*
I mean I know the server MrBean35000VR is on, he did a 24 player lobby. Not entirely sure if that will help though.
I mean if you're only using it for music, WiiRadio will suffice
I mean it broke, hence why Im getting win7 😛
I mean like, should I?
I mean sure, I could use my static data I already have, but does Github education have something to help with that as well? Im hoping its permeant.
I mean the reason I am taking fullscreen is because lightshot isnt on my pc rn. (New install)
I mean the zip file*
I mean there is just so much to do in the map, thx for upvotes guys, chive on buddies
I mean, cant we have mulitple wads with each name though? 🤔
I mean, couldnt WE recreate Wii Sports golf e3 2006 demo?
I mean, I think it does?
I mean, like, your guys's local backups 🙂 https://prnt.sc/us9faw I mean, I guess I dont want data to die? Espically Wii hard drives though, thats another thing I was apprenshive about 🙂
I mean, pentium 4 has decently held up (at least for seedboxes Im certain of)
I might ask my hoster if they can increase the VM's ram by about 3.5GB and then it should at least have enough power for medium-end usage.
I need cheese, I like that food, gib 😄
I noticed that earlier today, that's how you did the CMOC mii video right? 🙂
I pissed myself for two hours laughing at scratch bootlegs with @Mkwii64 and the guys, that was EPIC.
I prefer Centos personally, Larsen isnt going to hack me right? :/
I prefer R4i Gold 3ds rts or cyclods evolution, quality cards imo.
I prefer the Go version a bit, WUS is fun to study. (Well, from a Rii No Ma dev point of view haha)
I prefer to ``import as``
I prefer to pirate IDA, and pirate Nintendo dev stuff. (That and well I hoard VPNS 😛 )
I presume something is screwing up the request, 🤔 The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
I prob could yes, heck I could even prob hook it to Wii mail. (which would be funny to watch exchanges haha)
I probably need to enable 8 cores, but yeah. I'm going to get those 8 cores enabled now, reboot, then it should be done by 2-3PM if I do that.
I put that equation backwards, oh well it was a dumb joke anyway.
I ran out of google drive space 😅
I read your message Larsen regarding our service, and I want to thank you for that. In that sense, any new feature I make will come to your service too within a week. I want you to know also that I forgive you too for everything. Also, a very special e3 messevideo present is coming to this discord tonight.
I sadly can't actually, but I would use 4k video downloader if you can, or keepvid or y2mate or something like that.
I said hello to him, he hasnt responded back yet. Excellent to meet him, considering I have many questions for em.
I searched up tk free antivirus tk, and it gave me a porn site. (JUST LIKE STINKING VINESAUCE)
I selfhosted mine Larsen, it works rather cool, me and Snoot are likin it 🙂
I set it to VBR codec, thats why video looks weird (I have a crack for Bandicam, but I forgot to use it)
I shall use this modded version, I like it 😄
I should make a GIF of supa hot fire, and put my PFP on that (perfect weapon to defend agaisnt Mr. L)
I should state that the DS lite was backlit with a different screen, but it was the phat that had a AGS-001.
I should try to inject Larsen's mii into a homepass event, that would be fun
I sorta wanna try that ASCII thing + I wanna be a RC24 dev too. Would be fun 😄
I still can actually. (I can prove it even)
I still can't believe to this day that I was going to make this only on my Wii portables, I'm glad I didn't do that.
I still have it, I just forget where.
I still have to have it return data though.
I still need to learn rsa patching and domain records haha, I havent learnt how yet, but I can proxy pass still though :)
I think a package or something is missing 🤔 Are there any dependcies I need to install it on CentOS?
I think its because of that bracket at the bottom 😛
I think that is it's search indexer, but I dunno. (Why not use a daemon, steve 😛 )
I think wiimmfi has a seperate friend code engine, which in theory I shouldnt be completely screwed
I think?
I thought I blocked SSL in the script though 🤔 Maybe I still have the source code, one minute.
I thought it was haha, yeah, I have a lot to learn about it. Although Larsen, about the font, yeah, it has extremely good font support, Ill show you a sample that I used for it.
I use it on a OS-modding forum, its a rule on there to use that haha.
I used driver easy, but I think driver reviver might be a better one for me. I'll check in Speccy though, it might give me a lead.
I wanna ask about his Mail-GO project, Im thinking of messing around with it and trying her out for a spin.
I wanna be in this pic so bad, Ill add myself. Gimme 5 mins.
I wanna be one of the web devs, I am exceedingly proficent with CSS/JS/HTML.
I want a piece of cheese, fun fact actually, cheese is my favorite thing. (If you have cheese in your fridge for sandwich-only cheese, yea... dont trust me lol)
I want Golf 99
I want to apologize to ya dht for my behavior in OSC discord, i felt bad about it.
I was about to say, wiimotes arent THAT old (I still have my launch one, and it's perfectly matte white, no wear on mine.
I was gonna show you too paniaal actually 🙂
I was just wondering if anyone here has ever port-forwarded
I was just wondering: how does the Wii interface with GO files? Doesnt it do PHP?
I was laughing so hard that's why I wasnt speaking XD
I was studying evc (Larsen's dump), and I was wondering, do I need to organize them by date?
I was thinking that as well actually.
I was thinking that too actually, Ill get swap going rn.
I was wondering Larsen, why does RC24 and wiimmfi use apache and not nginx? Does it like handle traffic better?
I will add source later 🙂 I have the exact file with all the source 🙂
I will archive it actually, I have a server I can keep it on. 🙂
I will be adding it to a function if possible, I will try to 🙂
I will betatest it dht for win7
I will credit you when I release it 🙂 Im going to start modifying it right now to return CGI data like it should 🙂
I will encode the second Larsen 🙂
I will give you info in a bit here 🙂
I will not state the reason here, you will have to confer with me on DM's for that.
I will not switch because its a great software. 😄
I will not tron, may I remind you of that meme last night?
I will patch the WAD to have the routes inside it, I just need Snoot to teach me a bit about it first, as I'm not very good at patching WAD routes haha.
I will show you a vid of all the pages I have made, one moment.
I will the best I can, luckily I have a friend who knows kanji 🙂
I wonder if you can get the Wii number via HTML?
I wonder what place that text came from actually. One sec.
I wont get mad, I promise 😉
I wont overwrite the current OS, dont worry 🙂
I wont say another word, but I hope we can set our differences aside someday.
I worked for 8 hours Arturo :mew_shiny_cry: 
I would kill Reggie in his sleep to steal e3 2006 wii tennis beta, I swear I want it so bad 🤤
I would sound like a chipmunk if you heard my voice if I didnt deepen it on purpose lol, I dont have my deep voice yet hehe.
I would, but my drivers are installin. (I'll play with you guys when my Bluecore mod is fully setup, which will be done by tommorow.)
I'd help ya Rocket man, but it's been a year since I've done batch.
I'll make one later this week Larsen 🙂
I'll post it in RGD too as well, one sec. 😄
I'll probably be those nkit isos those for my Wii portable stuff Larsen, is there a more friendlier tool than NNASOS though? 🙂
I'll see if I can find it, It should still be on the interwebs I think.
I'll show you, one sec.
I'll try haha, Doordash hooker is the easy part. Now, getting the server's files, that's gonna be tricky and take a while.
I'll try the old one if possible.
I'm a bit curious. 🙂
I'm actually pretty good at Python, I usually minify my code so mine usually isn't big. But yeah, I might see if I can do some encodes for the Nintendo channel, that might be something I could try (Im like decent at mobiclip, and etc.)
I'm Feeling a bit better about yesterday. Wanted to apologize for it, for the parts that I caused.
I'm geniunely nor exaggerating nor kidding on that amount, now to find which one does CSRF and works best with File-Maker eh? (I presume the first two perhaps)
I'm going to be doing a codeacademy class as soon as I have time Larsen, I'm getting a job on saturday though + school is starting a new trimester. Hopefully practice should do well for now.
I'm going to try to encode those, @JG can you send me the windows software you used to encode those maybe?
I'm hoping to get some other HTML stuff done as well, thinking of a hud that shows which commit RC24.xyz is on.
I'm planning personally to free up server load by hosting cfh and miicontestp, and I'm going to be trying to bring back Kirby TV channel and Demae.
I'm thinking of putting movies on Wii No Ma, but that's the only way I could legally do it.
I've tested it, works fine 4 me.
Ich heiB 6100m! (See, I know a bit, but I cant do symbols on this keyboard lol)
IE ≤ 8.0 Multiple Denial of Service Bugs 0day test happening in Jenna roll Bacon, wanna come see? 😄
if config["production"] and config["send_webhooks"]:
If he shows in that screenshot I posted, that means he's still here basically.
If I was on my PC I would pdump the feck out of it, sorry if I cant rn zurgeg 😓
If it is, we SHOULD be fine I think.
If not, I could see if I can somehow inject it into the base64, because theoretically there should be a way to inject it at the exact spot it would be.
If you are wondering what I mean by that, that's DDR extreme's id.
If you can dump it, or figure out how to datamine it, i could try.
If you do Imora, I wanna play with it. (I mean I like prototype stuff, so yea)
If you think that one was bad Larsen, think again. 😛
iirc Spotlight did document the routes didn't he? I lost the link, but lemme see if I can find it.
Iirc there was some docs that TCRF/beta64 had on this, would that help @BamonBoy 2.1.6.9
iirc yea, I can prob check one sec
Ik he did, its a long night for us all.
Ik no one cares, let me have my fun flexing 😛
Ik unowe, but you havent lived until you've tried to install Windows 10 with this thing, o its glorious 😄
Ik 🙂
Ik, and dont worry Im not trolling, trust me yeah this will be difficult, espically due to the fact that no one has reversed the server, like ever. Im hoping to at least get the API part done, Ill do a PHP POC for Doordash API, gimme about 5-10 mins?
Ik, at least maybe his knowledge of how to do it might be a good techinque for other games
Ik, but it would be epic for this to fit.
Ik, I have plenty of licenses, legitmate and gifted to me by others. 😉
Ik, I just put it through transformer to see what it came out with. What I meant was it called us a twitter account haha.
Ik, I'll clean it, I just have to order a 1tb hdd
Ik, that's why I censored it.
Ik, was just thinkin about it
Ikr, google does that sometimes lol
Ikr? There should really be more games like that, I think it was a great innovation for its time.
Ill ask em later then
Ill fix it, fine 😛
Ill get er installed right after I upload the CDN 😄
Ill give you a hint: a mario cube.
Ill just mirror it then delete it from my server 🙂
Ill prob host it on yours then, Ill let you know when its ready so we can get the IP stuff goin 🙂
Ill see what I can do, no worries 🙂
Ill set speccy to analyze, I actually forget as it has been a while haha
Ill show ya a pic of one of them, one moment.
Ill show you a amazon pic of it, one sec
Ill show you another Sega game that was made exclusive for Nintendo.
Ill show you over in #content-wiigc 😄
Ill tell ya @Baconz , soak some pineapple in water, throw in some berries and some fruit, eat it and that smell is as good as gone.
Ill try imgur, one sec.
Ill use that one then, Ill prob make my first one today as my Sentry stuff is deployin
Im about northwest from Texas where you are Larsen I think.
Im admittingly a little worried about one thing, that is I dont know if friend codes are going to transfer over. But we.. will see.
Im almost there, sentry is my last hurdle.
Im already done actually flashing mine http://prntscr.com/t7p9fy
Im going to eat pizza, despite the fact eating it repeatetdly drives me banannas.
Im here for you fluffy, till the end.
Im just trying to survive @Saetta06 Everyone is sorta just getting at me a bit. Paniaal, I meant rii no ma lol
Im kidding lol, Im kidding
Im looking into messing around with a little mail server project, just for research to help me be able to develop on RC24 github projects.
Im making a API to log how many times people log into the DNS, Im calling the main API galvatron, and the secondary API neo 🙂
Im never releasing it though, for my streams only 🙂
Im not ignoring you Saetta, but you should sleep till 12
Im not kidding, that is the actual password to Kirby Tv channel's server. Sure it's down, meaning you wont get anything from it, but I found it hilarious.
Im not sure actually, maybe ask Snoot? 🤔
Im not sure fluffy, it cant be my card though but it must be the drivers I think. My card loaded stuff fine on Win10 I think. (o the redbees.blend)
Im not sure if I should believe Larsen.
Im not sure, I can check tho
Im not talking rn because Im not near my actual PC + Im not alone in the room haha.
Im not, Im just messing around with a new feature in Discord. https://prnt.sc/u0bdgu
Im still on win7, so Im safe
Im thinking of just merging GloomConnect24 into this server with it's own channel, and then just having GloomConnect24 as the codename for the US/EU engine. Your guys's thoughts?
Im your own dev paniaal. 😛
In 2012?
In a literal day after release.
In any case though, I have something to show to you all. Speaking of GTA.......
In fact, on that second part: I can actually see how to do it. If I can somehow route every line to individual array assignments, I should be able to. (Perhaps editing a text file for those line assignments would be best)
In fact, why dont I play one in jenna roll actually? One sec.
In other words, if the JQuery system is online. 🙂
In short I will prob have you open source it as credits will be weird if I do haha
in vc*
Instead of the actual code.. I think.
Instead of using github web to do the generation 😅
Intrestingly enough: I wonder if by abusing conntest to emulate it, I can bypass Wii updates. Should be fun to try.
invoxi* My brain is a little weird today, ah well I gtg for a bit guys, but I will pop back on later.
Io*
Ipod nano's can be put into a nes controller actually. (Fun fact)
Is there a way I can fix it maybe?
Is your volume up persay?
It actually has a two-stage gradient 🙂 One in the background, and one surrounding the text
It actually is, I have a schematic somewhere, I just need to find mine.
It actually makes me cry a bit happily looking back 🙂
It allows me to make Gecko codes.
It checks if JQuery is active 🙂
It did admittingly.
It did Larsen, but Im glad I figured it out 🙂 I did a quick sanity check by visting http://weather.wii.rc24.xyz/1/008/short.bin and sure enough, the directory structure of the save path is a perfect match. Ill show you my work soon 🙂
It didnt, but with these cron jobs it prob will 🙂 @Paniaal You can if you want.
It does seem like the better option actually.
It does support it 😄
It even has cfh I just don't know to license this thing properly so I can open-source it
It gave me a couple more 🙂 Going to try to capture them, but yeah, that command worked 🙂
It has been so long since I have seen this data... @Imora I had this enviorment for PS hacking 🙂
It has to be, for security 🙂
It installed fine on my Win7 JG, so I dont see why not 🙂
It is a bat to exe converted file.
It is a upscaled version, its pretty decent quality Larsen.
it is actually the entire thing, it is a company that makes the shirts for the Wii no ma shop. The distributor if you will.
It is amazing we achieved it.. Cheers guys! ;)
It is intended to work on armhf.
It is not a coincidence, that is why I named it that. Imma go eat lasgana, see ya later 🙂
It is yes. It can even run DSI nands which is cool (I have tested it myself, works great minus slight audio glitches!)
It is, I freaking love it's assets.
It is, yes. Brb guys gonna go eat crappy ol taco bell XD
it is? I saw a pic on yt of it, cant wait to try it 😄
It isnt a game, but the voice is so bad lol.
It like just doesnt boot anymore
It looks like a feather from a bird's butt lol XD
It might, but.. why?
It never expires though right? The github education thing.
It requires these files to be in the same directory as it.
It used a AGS-001 screen.
It uses Eagle btw
It was a clone of yours @Larsenv I tried to bring back your Wii HTML project 🙂
It was a reference to a Scott the woz vid, I was making fun of taco bell haha.
It was a reference to this video, ill show ya.
It was my first time Larsen hehe, but heck, thanks for letting me know, Ill push changes later 🙂
It will be a VM within Ubuntu to host it, Ubuntu is going to be used for CoWFC 🙂
It worked on python3 thanks to spotlight, Im somewhat quite excited to test!
It worked! 🙂
It would yeah, I'll be using Mail-Go's route implementation, that should be rather excellent 🙂
It'll be faster, and I just wanna help both my service and RC24 🙂
It's actually built in, thankfully.
It's all the same development.
It's for error logging, and yeah, my Pi can't run it sadly (even with swap! 🤔 )
It's pratically finished, actually.
It's primarily now being used on my crawler VM for my mobiclip encoding stuff.
It's so I can use wiino in html 🙂
It's the installer from https://github.com/DorkmasterFlek/python-nlzss
It's the name of the engine I made for the Wii No Ma shop, albeit a little messy rn.
Its a interesting little channel and I like it for some reason (I mean Ig it's because of the weird circumstance of it?)
Its a mix between a border collie and a australian sheperd, I think she is jealous of my beagle haha.
Its a vpn
Its alr fluffy 😄 No worries
Its alr, no worries 🙂
Its basically the Wii disc drive connector, I cant figure out what part it is on digikey or mouser.
Its both really.
Its for Sentry, yeah it needs docker.
Its fun though, I did it for a pretest for my web design class to flex my skills.
Its gloom, but eh, pronouce how ya feel, youre not the first person haha, dw about it its fine. You've been well I presume LMG07?
Its in the code instead of a config.
Its Larsen's stock code
Its legal. https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/wii/950924-wii-music/saves
Its my devkit picture collection
Its not porn, its Wii HTML stuff.
its not really bloat, its just more of a stockpile thing.
Its not rogue, why do you think people pirate it lol? https://prnt.sc/thvzpi https://prnt.sc/thvzvx
Its on mariocube iirc
Its opera, we dont need to talk about it lol
Its python lol
Its sorta a custom ico pack thingy, that and Peazip 😛
Its the mario
its this
Its to have my crontab only have one line, to make it clean.
Ive done it actually, Ive manually done it via gecko codes.
Ive never changed mine either tbh.
Ive never used magick before, but looks cool (ffmpeg but for images, neat)
Just do region patching on Priiloader lol XD
Just find a tool that removes files when your PC reboots, tools exist.
Just for fun, because Im bored haha
Just gotta find my thread on leece's forum, I have it there somewhere
Just like wondering which language Wii's HTML servers use the most so I can get a POC API hook going in a hour.
Just need to use the forks I made of your software to mod the binaries, then push to them.
Just please stop, I just dont wanna fight.
Just so ya know, yeah I might PR the fix on monday, along with importing cbc new canada rss feeds.
Just use Onschwarzenegger, easy.
Just waiting for someone to talk in chat, then we will begin over at my twitch, we are watching pokemon in 1080p hd
K 😛
Keep me updated guys, I will try to help as much as I can 🙂
Kudos unowe, now I can listen to katamari while I work on my server :3
l:g DS Phat screen
Larsen also keeps it in Mariocube-WC24 and I know that because I frequently hook into it for my web design class
Larsen dissassembled kirby tv channel's swf once, but it was a dead end. Not to mention, get this...
Larsen's first, you are third. 🙂
Larsen, do you have a min? Im having a little trouble with SSH on something. Basically, my Pi logs in to my CentOS server fine, but windows refuses. If someone else logs into that Pi, and logs in to my server, it doesn't work for them. Why is it doing that?
Larsen, File-Maker spit this out.
Larsen, how did you get syscheck working again? Im thinking about giving it a try 🙂
Larsen, I hope you dont get mad when I say this, but can you and me just start over? My feelings are a little hurt, but I just want to be able to talk to you again and... I just want to be friends again.
Larsen, I noticed something really weird about Wii Mail! Dolphin's ssl log will try to view nwc24msg.bin or something?
Larsen, I will say one more thing to you on this whole matter of how you hate me. If we can't get along, then you're my rival.
Larsen, Im working on the DNS login counter, and I thought you might want this file 🙂
Larsen, what's Rii Play?
Larsen, you do self-host Sentry right? Just wondering, because I am not sure if my install worked 😛
Last pic of my crap guys, yo lets go! 11 hour MOVIE
Let me guess: it came from China 😛
like .mii files, not just instructions.
Like for instance Larsen, let's say I went on the demae channel page.
Like I said, take me with a grain of salt at times, espically when its close to night for me. Im a little delirious 😛
Like if they have skill to make all this, they have to at least know SOMETHING about RFID security.
Like it just gave no console output
Like people have killed it in hours.
Like so.
Like terwebz is making me really unformatble, and a bit inapporiate.
Like that.
Like the map model is there and all, we would just have to recreate some assets, such as images and textures, and it might actually be possible.
Like THIS for instance.
Like utils is installed @Larsenv But I think I am missing something.
Like we can literally dump them on the server itself, without any need for FTP 😄 (Speaking of which fluffy, could you and me discuss some hosting stuff later on DM's?)
Like, I didnt even modify it :/
Like, I think the embed broke lol.
Like, if so, I can probably get them put into a route, or a CGI script might also be a good way too.
Like, is there a way I can fix this?
Like, it leaked our emails in the member page, it's honestly the only thing about Cloudflare that makes everything insecure.
Like, its the latest in starboard, or just search it
Like, maybe a collections dict perhaps?
Like, reason why is iirc it will treat it as one string, you dont want that 😛
Literally the c64 sound effect for this sounds SO much better on the C64
Logs*
LOL
Lol I'll behave. 😄
Lol my status will remain that status for like a month, as I do my personal Wii projects.
LOL OMFG 😛 Twice I had that happen
Lol saetta if you want it big, just use waifu2x.
Lol sorry about that haha, also Larsen, I have plans to write a entire WC24 service in Go. And I am giving you full perms to use it, without the license restrictions.
lol this bot thing is so funny, im taking our discord messages and putting them through this autocompleter.
Lol this bot tries to like insult people sometimes, its bizarre. Its text synth btw
Lol wat 😛
LOL 😛
LOL, how the heck did anyone even get by with that? 😛
LOL, they moved it from the cola screen hack, they are so funnily hackable XD
LOL, 😛 I mean this https://prnt.sc/uiiw3b
Luckily I wasnt drinking water or my dell e228wfp would have gotten sprayed when I saw that laughing 😛 Are the mii's public though, I should try putting them in tomodachi sometime.
Luckily my shell.exe tool will instantly open command prompt and I can slipstream commands into it too 🙂
Luckily too, I kept most of the source code as well 🙂
Lucky, I dont get that sadly.
Lul
lul use this https://www.zamzar.com/convert/midi-to-mp3/ and use wiimp3 or wiiradio, its easier.
Made by Larsen actually 🙂 Back in the day before RC24 was a thing, Larsen made that background 🙂
Made this to assist some friends of mine with RAAE01 WBFS directory structure.
Make that double.
Make that triple 🤮 @GamerKGR
Mario but cringe italian voice!
mariocube.xyz 🙂
Masterpiece Saetta, absoulte masterpiece :3
mates*
Me and my devs are having fun :blobpopcorn: https://prnt.sc/us8nzc
Me and that Windows 10 went through a lot together, a lot of my 2020 mods were done with it.
Me as well, I have a compatible OS 🙂
Me too fluffy, I wonder if you can emulate the HDD?
Me too, I might play a little less crazy with my dog and try to get her calm. We wrestle and play a lot, but I think she just needs some sleep.
Mediafire maybe? That's the only one that I have free space on.
Meh, I dont feel challenged with WC24 stuff, thats why I do these things.
Mii's are fish.
mine too
Mkw sadly called it but do a vid on your channel to advertise if ya can :)
Mkwii I think I figured out the sum! (666)
Mkwii is really good with cmoc.py, best in class 🙂
Mojave it is then 🙂
Most of them were coded by me, but a few werent 🙂
Much better
Much better, enjoy everybody (you too Jordan and unowe, enjoy guys)
My brother has like onboard audio and I dont, I wish I did :3
My dad knows russian I think. (That and I have friends on a forum who do)
My dogs just attacked me unforunately, but @Larsenv , so I know you've opened up a crapload of Wii Remotes, but are these schematics real? (I know that I uploaded to 000webhost, but it's for sake of me hurrying and getting these off to ObscureGamers today. Like Im going to bed in a hour or two :P
My favorite cfw name, right next to Luma3ds
My gigatron tool is v0.9-alpha.4 currently 🙂
My hands are covered in cat hair.
my led daemon fits on a 256 Byte 1 page EEPROM too!
My motor scooter was skectchingly overclocked in factory 😛
My patched version of Forecast Channel's File-Maker, unsure if i did the owncloud part right as I am uncertain if you put quotations or not.
My WiiConnect24 toolkit! 🙂
My Windows 7 mod has it built in, so its always been easy for me
n64 schematics release! enjoy guys! 😄
Nah
Nah im tired of DOT Net breaking all the time haha.
Nah its fine, yeah some of it was filler haha, I admit 😛
Nah with the key 🙂 As for DS stuff, you mean the LZ compression right? If so, I am working on that actually.
Nah you're fine Larsen, also Larsen, I finally figured out how your EVC script works. sys.argv[2] is the question you insert, right?
Nah, I filled it out a month or two ago 🙂
Nah, Im clear near the border of Canada 🙂
Nah, its a PCB designer. (Best in Class!)
Nah, its art of gloom meant to look a little cute.
Name a version, ill give you a downloader.
Nano :oof:
Need any help JG? It is bedtime and I dont quite feel like turning on my Fedora VM, but if I must, I must.
Neo can do quotes, and Galvatron can do a lot more. For instance... (I still need to start, but I have it planned out now, somewhat)
Neutral for me personally. I do both from time to time.
Never gonna release it tho, its for me and people who get wii portable commissions from me 😄
Nevertheless sorry about asking people twice haha, but I am going to try it tonight! 🙂
New setup for RC24 coding. https://prnt.sc/thw8zo Now all it needs is some celestia related apps, a linux VM, and Windows is your oyster.
newsdownload.py, newsmake.py, and news.py iirc 🙂
Nice glitch! 🙂 I can try to slipstream the gecko code in, I think it is possible.
Nice homebrew collection there paniaal, but yeah you should use MMM. Speaking of which Larsen, why does wii.guide recommend Wii Mod Lite? I always wondered why a bit.
Nice job man! 🙂
Nice job Saetta, I like your transparent PNG stuff you did for the logo, stellar.
Nice job Voaly, make sure you seal your phone back up well, since you melted the glue when you opened up the chassis. Just a thought 🙂
Nice you three, congrats 👏
Nice 😄 Rerember when xat was the thing back then?
Nice 🙂 I will catch everyone later!
Nice, can I add these CGI's to my CGi script project? 🙂
Nice, I will join in about a week, got a small handful of stuff to do first, but should be ready by saturday 😄
Nice, this will be a smexy feature 🙂 Rocket can help you with votes.py, he has modified it in the past too 🙂
Night dht :)
Night everyone, ~~enjoy the frog legs lol~~
Night guys, (I wish I had a picture of a gloom with a nightcap on, I want it so bad ;o )
Night my devs, may your work prosper. *afk*
Night voaly 🙂
Niiiicccceeee Wii no ma is getting closer!
Nintendo, by recycling that screen, made a MISTAKE.
Nitro, you missed a spot. :lenny: https://prnt.sc/thwbid
No @pengu as the internal switch FOR THAT isn't on that slot.
No demae used demae-can, which is not avaibile in the US. So we have to find a different API 🙂
No it plays from SD iirc
No it was.
No its a twitch bot
No like Larsen, that wasnt the image it was supposed to do haha https://prnt.sc/u9pkil
No one die on me ok?
No worries burrito, just when ya can 🙂 (You're not mad at me anymore though right?)
No worries mkw will be doin it :)
No worries then 😄
No worries then, and yes I do 😅 But I am taking a quick break. Going to show you guys my VM's, one min
No worries then, anything else I can help with Spotlight? 🙂
No worries, also Snoot, now that we have web dev enviorments, I kinda wanna be added to the github as CSS/JS/HTML I am really proficent in. I'm so excited to code for it, this will be fun 🙂
No worries, I agree actually. I plan to revise it at some point.
No worries, I will try to convert them as soon as I can 🙂
No worries, its alr 🙂 Also JG, I am going to learn Go today for the first time, https://gobyexample.com/writing-files and I will be studying Spotlight's go code to at least get a decent understanding of Go, so I can start writing in it. Go is actually going to be easier than Python I think.
No worries, its alr. https://glitch.com/edit/#!/alike-infrequent-bactrosaurus Here is the code rn btw, I have gotten better. I can always still be better though.
No worries, youre not the first person to think its numbers haha, its a l33t thing. (Thats actually why I chose that pfp about a year ago, to help a bit.)
No you can, read RGDWiki.
No, and here is proof. One sec.
No, I accidentally gave him the login 😛 But yeah, @Snoot 🐾 checking the access logs, that would be good.
No, I believe they do...
No, its just like you said, I should wait until I have something.
No, not really.
Nom, nom, nom. (We should make a give food bot, that would be epic)
Nope, still wont work @Baconz I need your help, I have even contacted my ISP and still nothing 😦
Not in canada but on a state that is on the border.
Not only that Soap, there's a modded version with the entire US library (DM me if ya want it, Ill give it to ya)
Not quite yet, I need sudo 😛
Not really, its just a savefile.
Not the gator saetta, not the gator!
Not to worry, I've been developing a P2P system to provide WADS, it's fine.
Not too bad Paniaal, although I would photoshop the everyone image out hehe.
Not too hard, Im guessing. I mean, Galvatron (this whole script project) is going to be a lot of work in general. At least, it will be a big learning experience for me that is.
Not you mkwii, we were tellin yoshi
Nothing will be not working, except for News, at least atm.
Now Ruben and Dark, play nicely, us three are buddies. 😄
Now that I actually have structure, making these Ig should be easy. Im going to get back to my schoolwork now, ciao buddies 🙂
Now that is smexy there Redbees, epic 😄 You should try running Framemeister through it too
Now to get my games installed + space software installed too.
Now, back to my schoolwork I go, so I dont flunk again 🙂
Np :) Im really excited for forecast tonight, have you ever used unbound maybe snoot?
Np fluffy 😄
np Redbees 😄 Here is a much better pic
Np 😄
Np 😄
Np 😄 And you too Redbees, you two are my best buds
Np 😉
Np 🙂
Np 🙂 I would contact hyper too, in fact, he owns a 000webhost server too, and me and him cross-deploy stuff between our servers.
nwc24dl.bin I actually meant this one haha, its been a while 😛
O and btw Baconz, are DM's ok with you? My DM's usually never arrive to ya I think 😛
O and fluffy, the uh bot, that was me haha. (I tried to put katamari star OST on and that happened 😛 )
O and guys, Im making a GUI for a cool little Dolphin NAND switcher. It automatically switches the foldernames around, with protection from merging too. Fun little project I made for me and sdhsako's dolphin corruptions since we use two NAND's for that. (Actually three, if you count our RC24 nand)
O and night ruben too, and even you Yoshi.
O and see ya too snoot I'll leave you to do the channels but the reason is so people can have a Wii
O and those are verified dumped DS tech demo ROMS btw. (perfectly PD I think too, not sure, o and submarine demo is there too) lots of e3 2004 stuff buddies!
O excellent 🙂
o god no
O goodness those eyes XD
O goodness, I think I just broke the bot lol. ||HELLLPPPPP||
O gtg mates, see you guys tommorow 😄
O he was a impostor? LOL I should've known.
O he's sorta a code collector/track maker, kinda like a younger, little bit more beginner Atlas basically.
O hey Hack2lose, we were discussin symbols 😄 Yeah it has em mates, discord embed is weird haha
O i will be selfhosting in about a month here I am prototyping with 000webhost
O just for extra audio quality
O my ears :/
O the animal crossing server 🙂
O the Larsen mii and baconz's miis and all of your guys's miis from tomodachi collection I always see. 😄
O the little dot elements and the smiley face
O those are just links to tutorials on installing themes/editing them, making them, hacking your wii, updating your wii, reinstalling homebrew channel and more.
O Trump just flew over the protestors.
O voaly, its n64 schematics 😄
O winnie the pooh, rerember the Disney channel animation? Yeah, they had a movie where rabbit had a party and stuff.
O yea 🤦‍♂️ One sec, Ill set it to 20000.
O, for my new tool JG 🙂
O, for the site 🙂 Basically its a cool little way for me to do stats
O, I found it in gc-forever 🙂
O, look at the python 🙂
O, this guy was wondering if there is another way to protect yourself besides Bootmii and priiloader, I think there is?
O, well nvm then, never heard of that one 😛
Oblivion PSP repack is almost finished, will be releasing it to you guys. Miku theme is nearly done on the PBP, I just need to do one more bugfix in each of them and then they work.
Oddly when I was really young, I was stupid and tried to use a unbanner to play on dolphin (young 6100m, you weren't banned in the first place, why?!) Then I tried to hack but luckily my dolphin install kicked my young ass, it disconnected after like 5 seconds :Kappa:
Of course on dm's though. 😉
Ofc vortex hates code now lol 😛
Oh and snoot, for hex patching domains, I made a padder :) cool huh?
Oh bois, first batch is almost done. Lets push DS to the limits!
Oh god you still rerember that 😛 I gave up on that so long ago, and I promise not to act like that again 🙂 I almost didnt rerember you, but I do now 🙂
oh good lord, is this duolingo
Oh I'm just thanking you urmum, because you were decent to me when I asked you the question.
Oh my hell, it is NOT canon. Not isnt even the word for it, it never will be 😛
Oh neat, I always liked the 2011 models's screen personally. 🙂
Oh nvm, someone already made a guide for Doordash API's. Huh. https://parseur.com/use-case/food-delivery-order-api-for-grubhub-eat24-seamless#how-to-get-started-with-parseur
Oh they are public now, nvm 🙂
Oh, I just thought it might look cool 🙂
Oh, I'm just thinking of fun projects to do for RC24, other than finding some decent Canada news sources w/ CSRF that I already will be doing.
Oh, it's concept will be used for the BC24.
Oh, just various things to assist me. As for miirender, yeah.... it rendered my orange hat mii as black haha.
Ok actually, I'll keep that image, I'll put it on my PFP on New's year's for fun.
ok brain 😛
Ok crazy story
Ok crazy story: some people on a server im admin on thought I was a girl because I had this skin. https://prnt.sc/u3qrug And I said, nope, Im just a weeb! 😛
Ok guys streaming anime over at http://twitch.tv/RefugeePlaysPokemon
Ok never mind, whatever 😛 Yeah I need to learn the commands.
Ok now where were we? Ah yes, Chungus. One moment guys, Dietpi is being a dodo again 😛
Ok Reggie will put you out of your misery, small indentured human.
Ok seems to be fine on my end, login was successful 😄
Ok sharqual and larsen, please knock it off. Im not saying anything bad in return, and Im not letting you both get under my skin.
Ok you might have to click the link, stupid discord.
Ok, I can probably do it. I have enough space for a VM too, so me installing a LastXP VM isn't a problem for me. (It even comes with VirtualDub)
Ok, Ill use first.txt to get the links from 🙂
Ok, one sec 🙂
Ok, who was in my credit card again buying bitcoin lol
On mariocube 🙂
On the device you adapted it for, yes. Not all sadly.
One big happy family. (I assume you'll get that reference Larsen, since you and me like those kid shows)
One moment, Ill grab it! 🙂
One more thing fluffy, make sure the path to it has no spaces, this script is fussy a little with that haha 😄
One of my goals is to make a Wii portable w/ RC24 and failsafe server. (At least RC24 for the moment, as long as I get that working, Ill be fine prob.)
One of the interesting and weird things about my drivers is it says I have a Intel GFX installed alonside it, which might be the issue.
One of them made by Larsen himself, the predessor to RC24, the magnum opus of our community. wc24.mariocube.com is Riiconnect24's predeccsor.
One question though: it works internationally right?
One sec, I'll check 🙂
One sllght error, the two elements on the left are overlapping.
OOF, well I shouldve archived that.
ooh nice 🙂 Speaking of which Rocket, whats your github username btw?
oops, sry 😛
Or a castle 😏
Or any coord for that matter 🙂
Or at least 3ds cfw for that matter*
Or at least I think that is a DHT 3/4 🤔
Or dht, we could theorecitally do a numbering system. Like for instance, 0 means something, and 1 means another thing. You know, for limited cases and somewhat unique variables like that.
or DM zurgeg or DM spotlight and ple...
Or maybe it was when you and me and fluffy were hanging out, I forget haha.
Or that 🙂
Or wait was it moflex? I always mix up the two, either way I can do pretty good at both.
Or you can if ya feel, no worries. Oh, and ssh & cc are needed sometimes because of SSL errors (they are python modules btw)
Over DM's of course.
Overall, I think if we just get a better moderation bot to moderate chat, this whole community wouldn't be falling to pieces right now (Not to mention, the fact that the service might die as well since people get pushed over the edge too much)
Paniaal, can you teach me that? I wanna learn bmg files too actually 🙂
Pardon? No worries though Baconz, a friend of mine on a forum is going to assist me with it.
Paris is a feminist/nazi, my least favorite type of human.
People like Yuzu and all, but I prefer Ryujinx.
Perfect DPG encode! 😍
Personally I like the lua fork :D
Personally I used archivarix to dump it, comes with a php script to backup stuff too
Personally, I liked DS/Wii virtual console because I grew up on those consoles. As for accessories, Ig a must have is that disc cleaner thing, that thing suprisingly may actually have data.
Pip3 :)
Please note that this version doesnt incl. a few stability improvements and edits.
Please work ;0
PokeAcer gave me those documents Hyper is showing 🙂
pokeacer.xyz/wii/pdf should still have it I think
Pokemon Movie 1
Potential forecast test tonight :) Speaking of which snoot, I get asked this quite a bit: what pronoun do you go by?
Pretty little XP you got there Burrito, nice.
Preview for the channels we'll use for corruptions tommorow @sdhsako 🤗
Prob yes. AY I just wish RiiConnect24 could just stay afloat at times. This whole fight and argument with unowe, then the previous guy who left, that didnt need to happen.
Prob, after I figure out why I am being rate-limited on Accuweather 😅
Processing ./nlzss-0.1.2.tar.gz
PSPISO*
Psst... @TMinusBlastedRocket DM me for that.
Pure JS!
Pwn em then Dylan 😛
Read Riiconnect24's kaitai files and this https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-channel-reverse-engineering-results.362973/
Ready JG, lemme know when you login 🙂 Click on your profile icon btw, it should show a @somethingsomething and then paste that here so I can add ya
Ready to invite ya zurgeg, spent some time doing some cleanup 🙂
Really installing those both are the only way, ol buddy.
Reason it's 4/5 because one of our devs's Windows was acting up.
restarted wifi, can anyone hear me? 😄
Right below that 20 something thingy, on the far left.
riitags*
root*
Same here, well ash and voaly, ciao buddies. (One more thing, Ill invite you as well Ash 🙂 )
Same with dsi.
Savemii was made before it, and Savemii wasnt really a ram hacker like a USB-Gecko.
Screw it, Im just going to install it via setup.exe 😛
SDK/Nintendo and then replace youknowwhat with mega
Second part is uploading too, one min
Second pic, this will look so good on a DS screen at least 🤤 It may look bad, but rerember the DS is 256x192 and I am in fullscreen lul
See ya guys later
See ya guys later ;D
See ya guys later, have fun with your hackintoshes 😄
See ya 😄
See? Easily beats NES classic mods.
See? Perfect match.
See? Simple and efficent.
Sees top-loader... sees famicom... WTFFF
Sentry/Froxlor/Webmin for WC24 stuff is a good mix.
She is the person who ruined e3 2008
Shes cute, she looks like my dog. But yeah so has mine 🤣
Shit, there goes my bot :mew_shiny_cry:
Simple to get going 🙂
Simply run shell.exe then do
Since I have 16gb USB 3.0 I am rather limited.
So basically, we need to modify github.com/RiiConnect24/File-Maker (directory: Channels/News_Channel) And we need to modify that instead of using google maps api, it uses OSM 🙂
So guys, found the Flipper datasheet and Gekko datasheet in nocvs, intrigued me a little because it sounds like that the chip is avaibile upon request, sorta in limited access and kinda like a request-only Digikey part of sorts. Like, it sounded almost as if it was avaibile to other companies to use which I found neat.
So guys, I have something weird to show you. I know now what this thingy does.
So guys, I replicated one of nintendo’s more boring servers. ’’6100mifi-server-001.000webhostapp.com’’ My next project is making a PHP based Doordash API Hooker.
So guys, thinking of doing a little personal DNS that hooks up to my servers, rc24 servers, and wiimmfi all in one. It would be nice since I can block malware sites with it too.
So guys, wanted to show you this (This ties in with that pdn file I gave baconz 🐽+ 🪓 =  🥓) https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/the-definitive-wii-trimming-guide.198/#lg=_xfUid-21-1594773137&slide=0
So guys, what are we working on atm? I might be of help.
So guys...
So in that sense, gtg guys but see ya later, ciao everybody ❤️
So just to educate myself.
So ladies and gents, what did I miss?
So Larsen, I had a cool idea. What if for the RC24 DNS, we did analytics through conntest to check how many people log in to the DNS?
So Larsen, I have a small gift for ya. (Something cool I found) https://www.ebay.com/itm/50-Nintendo-Wii-Development-Debug-Discs-RVT-R-Single-Layer-Discs-RVT-004/253340602538?hash=item3afc46d0aa:g:JaUAAOSw94taCk3U But thats not all, I wanna show you my picture archive of devkits too. https://toadiller.000webhostapp.com/birthdayideas/ and https://toadiller.000webhostapp.com/ebbbbaaaayyy/
So Larsen, Im thinking maybe ajax /GET requests might be a good method, ALTHOUGH we could just code it in Go probably.
So larsen, rerember wc24tool? I was playing with it again 🙂
So Larsen, vp.wii.wiilink24.com I fused miicontestp, vtp and the poll lister by t27duck into one.
So larsen, what was z.sh used for? I was playing with it a week ago or so 🙂
So Larsen, you accidentally leaked riitag’s sentry url, just wanted to let ya know.
So let me get this straight, Reader used TTS and everyone is mad?
So like, because of those special characters it breaks? @Larsenv
So like, what if we obsufcated the variables in the database to make them smaller? I suspect that we could prob do base64, or obsfucate it to a CRC32 hash calucation and have a SQL database to decrypt those hashes. That has been on my mind ever since reading through the github issue to add snowflake.
So paniaal, you did that with my mii file? Lol its possessed mii then, O goodness 😛
So small, not even a header 😛
So that way Wine can compile without the script getting in the way 🙂
So ugh, I would've been done with the whole service by now, but sadly, our SSH software is playing tricks on us :leafeon_cry:
So urmum, turns out https://prnt.sc/upcmjr here is the fix 🙂
So Voaly, I wanna sorta develop something for RC24? Is there like, something I could try making?
Somehow Driver Easy had one fail, out of all the times I used it (well actually, it DID fail with Win7 gfx drivers, like Angrylion RDP plus messes up loading it)
Sorry about that there Kcr, I gotta run anyway. See ya later then?
Sorry I streamed with the wrong account, stream is online now.
Sorry lol, discord goofed that.
Sorry rocket, this one was really vital
Sorta, basically the https://prnt.sc/u3t65g file that Techincabor gave me is a raw pcm sample for it from the C64, and it sounds better actually. But yeah, NES sample, :youtried:
Sorta, that downloads the static data the Forecast WAD downloads 🙂
Speaking of which guys, anyone interested in my wii.com backup? (Took a backup about a month ago)
Speaking of which JG, how is the server comin?
Speaking of which Larsen, I found something a little odd in mariocube? Rerember the old soundtracks you had hosted? There was a .DS-Store file in there and it showed a downloads path from your hackintosh which I found intriguing. Oddly enough, me still being a iOS hacker I have yet to learn what .DS_Store does haha.
Speaking of which Larsen, one thing that always trumped me at least with WC24, like, isn't News Channel possible without geocoding? I mean, normatim is a NIGHTMARE to run.
Speaking of which Larsen, wanted to tell ya. In requirements.txt, you put newspaper3k instead of newspaper haha, 3k connectes to the python 3 repo, not the python 2 repo.
Speaking of which mkwii, can you teach me how to add contests? 🙂
Speaking of which though Larsen, I found something weird. You know how Mac/Hackintosh indexes stuff in a sorta orphaned folder? Well, looking at your forecast channel ost on mariocube, the index is still there actually. So like for instance, the path would show this iirc.
SRC 🙂
SSD, MicroSD card speeds SUCCCCKKKKK
Still though, I wasnt putting them down, I'm just going to be rewriting larsen's code to go, for both the services. Im not agasint them in any way.
Streaming altium designer schematic creating in General 2 in about a min here, no mic because I am sick.
Streaming rn in General 2 if you mates wanna watch, just barely begun 😄 I got mk64 music on too so there's that
Streaming Windows XP destruction tonight in Jenna roll, me and sdhsako hope to stream either at 4PM or 8PM
Stuff that I have repacked is Civ2, Sardu PRO, and a Big Fish Games Master collection (WIP)
Supposedly nintendo channel should have a near close version of mobiclip
Sweet dreams Voaly, night! 🙂
tar xf yourfile.tar.gz 🙂 I think I have it nearly memorized (well, almost)
Tbh I have bad dreams I wont say to others, so yea same boat haha
Tbh I wish this community would just get along about all that kind of stuff @fluffy
Tbh tron was rude to me. Anyhoo, gl on your projects Varon and you guys survive COVID ya hear? Anyhoo, gn guys and live life like it's 2006! 😄 6100m out.
TDEV hooked up to DHT 3/4, huh cool fluffy. 😄
Tell him I miss em, he was a good guy to me too. 😄
test_mode = 0 means to do Forecast Channel with data test mode
testing in a little bit 🙂 Once I get both of my VM's setup, I will test 😄
Thanks Arturo 😄 I actually gtg guys, but ill be back tonight
Thanks fluffy ol' buddy, cheers! 😄
Thanks for the tip there @unowe 🙂 As a thank you, enjoy a small gift from you to me!
Thanks for upvotes guys, will do a small emote contest next week as a thank you!
Thanks mates, as a thank you, here is a present for you guys.
Thanks nyami and DJ voaly, chive on buddies 😄 (As a thank you, I will be releasing my CoWFC server to the public for ya guys. Just a little bonus for those who like gecko codes.)
Thanks snoot 🙂 See you both in the mornin 🙂
Thanks soap and voalyball 😄 As a thank you, I will DM you both a present (I posted it earlier, but meh).
Thanks spotlight, it's going to be rather smexy 🙂 I am even making a couple DEB's for Cacti, just some scripts that show generic documentation, but a couple other tools too, like the CMOC force update script 🙂
Thanks to everyone who laughed with me! 😄
Thanks 🙂
Thanks 🙂 Got my dump from archivebot extracted, time to figure out what goes where 🙂 (I know where animal crossing goes, but My aquarium I dont, but I can figure that out)
Thanks 🙂 I am going to seperate some of the functions into a seperate file, I like to make my code modular and highly integrated. Some of the variables actually get formatted via functions.
Thanks 🙂 I will hopefully be distributing stuff right after me and fluffy cross-deploy some stuff, as we will have a better working setup (For instance, I plan to have fluffy host the secondary DNS, and I host primary)
Thanks! 🙂 Its fake weather currently, but I am going to eventually put in real data
Thanks, 😄 You said you wanted the Wii backup disc, amirite? I have it buddy if ya want, I'd be more than happy to give it to you.
That actually looks amazing, Trinitron ftw!
That and having a second server yeah, to basically have something for the Japanese channels to live on. Although yeah, I plan to add the new features, Im just testing rn then I prob will 🙂 Dont worry, I've been hiring people for the watch shifts. As for News, I was thinking OSM 🤔
That and I have been repacking Movie Ch. Install disc lately as well. Need to trucha sign and I am done!
That and I might do a test-match with ya on Wiimmfi (since that will be on the DNS)
That and one line rc.local too.
That and the fact I can manipluate PE to heck.
That could be arranged :) Youll like my Gigatron tool Dogmander, its really easy to use :)
That enables 8gb swap on our servers.
that ill port*
That is 000webhost's file manager, it used to suck but its now pretty decent (well, not as good as webmin though)
That is a bruteforcer also that is known to only replicate the algorithm. I cannot vouch for its success rate, but heck from what I can tell it works decent somewhat.
That is a glorious idea actually Larsen, but how would we dump them all though?
That is a working cheat on Roblox that I just posted, so yea you can hack it lol.
That is insane Redbees, nice job 🙂
That is one way 🤔
That is the XP version I use burrito, install is going smooth.
that like you need done
That reminds me actually, Discord had another big hiccup about a few months ago. rerember when messages duplicated a whole bunch?
that reminds me, I have a showcase html of some of my ebay pic collection, one moment 🙂
That should help rather excellent, since we need to sniff out the URLS.
That should say .json, will fix 🙂
That version basically has bugfixes -- actually on second thought that one I should remove something first.
That was a test run 🙂
That was a video, yeah I forgot those were broken 😛
That was going to be my next guess haha 😛
That will be later changed 🙂
That will be worked on after I get a few channels going 🙂
That would be best probably yeah, one min 🙂
That's because I did high-res copies lol
That's impossible without a PNG/JPEG exploit, but you are on the right track. @Saetta06
That's kinda what we are doing, the Rii No Ma devs will be tending to make sure it doesnt crash (they are not in the same time zone, so its ideal since they are up later than I am)
That's one of my JB's.
That's the plan 🙂
That's the script rocket gave me
That's the web panel Snoot? 🙂 Looks cool, I wonder if we could kind theme it like webmin though?
That's true actually unowe, I did that when I was in the GPD discord and came back a year later.
That's what I used too, modmii is best 🙂
That's why I backup that stuff, even if its boring.
That, and I am decent with PHP a bit.
thats a awful pic actually, stinking google haha one sec
Thats a cool AI 🙂
Thats a cool little bot actually 🙂
Thats better,
Thats copyrights,
thats the ID system I implemented you are looking at @jordiisepic
Thats the one. 🙂
Thats the thing, just no error. It just refuses to run. As for that log, where is it persay?
Thats the wrong html, oopsie 🙂 One min
The DLC server for wii 🙂
The ds shells are nice tho.
The food bot*
The JSON importing for the api requests is a WIP.
The link that is.
The one on the left.
The only midi worth playing is Larsen's Wii + internet remaster.
The password is ```static var REMOTE_PASSWORD = "m0b!cl!p4ulz";```
The private one is key.0.pem 🙂
the server*
The skin is a WIP.
The usb gecko clone I made, Ill show ya. One sec.
The virus only works on WinXP because of the OOBE assets it abuses. @Sneexy
The website 🙂
The weirdest part of my collection. I call these the dumpster schematics, for a reason. Atari 7800 schematics some guy found in a dumpster.
Then I can put the payload data in those functions 🙂
Then it's ready 🙂
Then sky3ds came along, and gateway was crushed to the ground like the slimebags they are (They bricked thousands of 3ds's because, oh no, people used Pasta and whatnot, Gateway has to stop that :thonkang: )
Then your risk is high lol 😛
Theoretically you could decently apply it to File-Maker, but thats really cool how it gens questions actually.
There is a bold variant right? @Larsenv
There is a MSX cursing bootleg. Here is a accurate represnation of its cursing voice clip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n90yfVPv_wc Not even kidding, it literally sounds as bad as this.
there we go 😄
There you are Larsen.
These are some cool Wii No Ma show rips, and a handful of gaming-related stuff.
These are WHAT we were laughing at, not this server 😛
These two 🙂
They are different OS'es, I have two Fedora VM's, a win7 vm, a winxp vm, and a ubuntu vm.
They are reputable pen-testing tools, some of the best in the industry (I like iOS security research)
They can just connect to my dynamic server.
THEY EVEN USE RFID ON THE MACHINE LOL FOR SOMETHING TRIVIAL 🤣
They had a database on their site of CMOC miis.
They mustve sung that phrase for like 5 mins haha.
They were done with Advanced BAT To EXE converter pro 🙂
They will, and having it CGI makes it really easy! 🙂
Think of it like this, a GUI-Less program.
Think we could maybe create these scripts Snoot? 🙂 https://prnt.sc/uubkw9
Thinking about maybe adding canada news, not sure what prfArc is however.
Thinking of starting a ios security firm with ya @Snoot 🐾 I noticed you were on reddit and that you like ios jailbreaking 🙂
This has some of the stuff you will need to do all this.
This is a very special pic. Before I met Snoot, and all of you, it was just me working on WL24. This is the birth.. of WL24. 😍 Awww memories, little baby WL24 before it was known.
This is the best thing ever XD
This is you right?
This was a bunch of old data I had in feburary  for a PS3 hacking commission, which still isnt finished. It feels good to see this data again 🙂
This was the other popular anime thing back in the day. (which just became 10 years old a month ago)
Those are my database keys 😛
Those are my set of debug tools I use 🙂
Those are the public production ready forecast and ios31 btw, be sure to download and upload directly
Those are the software flags I put in place to help check what mode it's in 🙂
Those were the days, I still have my cart. (That cart is invincible, it survived water and heavy corrosion)
though*
Three, two, one.
Time to hack my DSI with some anime moonshell, any cool replacement servers I can hook into?
Tip of the iceberg
To be honest, yes.
To start us off LMG, let's do.. this one! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n90yfVPv_wc
Traceback (most recent call last):
Tron, you're talking to a guy who has the Matrix Slowdown code, Freeze WW code, Invisi-Bean code, and a lot of others. You sure you'll win 😛
Trump 1, Native Americans 0 😛
Trust me, I bricked a Wii by being a dodo, Im gonna be better about it haha
Two cool things actually
Uh artuto, I think I bricked mysql. I need help 😛
Uh I had some repl.it enviorments that had it working, would that be good?
Uh wut. (Oh the arctile is a prank, you little stinker 😛 )
Uh you can try to sniff it out in that one disk manager command, unowe remind me, was it gptfdisk ot something?
Unforunately the install failed, so I had to try again. Ill try to get it done soon though.
unowe, how do I view other's Riitags? I wanna play with Riitags 🙂
unowe, why do you have a blank pfp?
uploaded the remaining three JG 🙂
Uploading my pages to see what you guys think 🙂 One min.
Use MMM lol.
Use my generator Voaly, it should serve ya well 😄
Use youtube-dl + aria2 combo, so much faster.
Use zorin @Diego lel
VBA sucks tho 😛
Very good Larsen, I used your Mariocube assets this time without using HTML! Cool huh? Wanna see my code?
Very well then JG, I shall do it another time. One moment, I'll write some youtube-dl commands you can use to grab em 🙂
Very well then Larsen, very well. I have one question Larsen, is the optimized Wiimmfi server engine code avaible anywhere? I might take a crack at it maybe.
Very well then, any online Wii game you like to play?
Very well then, I promise I will. Also larsen, this printful api is cool eh?
Very well then, I shall go afk and leave this small message on record.
Very well then.
Wait how do the libertyland servers optimize RAM? @Artuto Im doing a MC server as well, so I was just wondering if you dont mind me asking.
WAIT WHAT LOL, why did that render like that 🤣
Wait, shouldnt there be a comma after the first one? @urmum_69 I think I get what happened.
Wait, where are we working? I can try to help maybe if its hexdata stuff, but I only have my hex editor installed so that's all I can do rn ;p
Wanna see? 😄
Was doing some eeprom stuff, and my data got killed because I accidentally deleted stuff. OOF there goes my Wii portable's eeprom, let's hope I can recover the code.
Was going to code a TTS mod of KcrPl's script today, but after my shots my left arm stings and I can barely move it unless I have it laying on my leg..
We are exploiting IE ≤ 8.0 for fun and profit, WeirdPerson.
We are getting close 🙂
We are just exploring the github 🙂
We are meeting in Staff VC 🙂
We are singing Rick astley over in jenna roll guys
We do have 3 servers atm, and soon there will be more lol.
We dont know the root and root auth is broken ;/
We got miis working Snoot?
We got past some of the errors, and we are getting past this one soon 🙂
We havent uploaded yet.
We just need to bootup the VM first though.
We might.
We need to put rc24 in youtube ads.
We should mess around with yours and my custom version of Docker Snoot maybe sometime again, rerember the ARM version you and me made? 🙂
We tried guys, more practice and soon we will have perfect unision 🖖
Well Endless is broken forever because of ratelimits :/ There is like a bot called Groovy that's always worked for me though.
Well he said bananna 😛
Well hello there Citrus Wolf, I don't believe we've met?
Well I am going to put on Super mario galaxy gusty garden galaxy because that might keep me awake.
Well I have done this iOS 1.0 jailbreak for starters, one sec Ill show ya.
Well I have scans of the disc, but yeah hold on a min Imma ask a buddy of mine if its ok
Well I installed a new chrome, lets see if it fixes itself.
Well I mean I am getting a Pi server so it wont be a problem soon. It just isnt that great for now.
Well I mean there was THAT one incident (if you wanna talk about the porn genesis game)
Well it wasn't me ;p Speaking of which though Spotlight, I kinda just wanted to say sorry about me kind of being a bit repitive about wanting to be a dev again, sorry if I was a bit annoying on that, I'll be better :)
Well JG dinnertime for me, see ya JG and snoot 🙂
Well Larsen you have fun with MiiCharacters im going to bed, hopefully I can at least do the base stuff implemented for R(B)C24 File-Maker, ive been a bit busy admittingly but heck, Im going to be doing it tommorow anyway so yeah.
Well Larsen, Im going to bed seeing this nightmare of a Wiimote.
Well r4 clones dont have the same quality, like this for instance. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000722859967.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.61f566191m083q&algo_pvid=a1bd9e83-9140-4c20-b1c6-4ded493a0b2d&algo_expid=a1bd9e83-9140-4c20-b1c6-4ded493a0b2d-3&btsid=0ab6f81e15941721450932778e5e9c&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_ Its a r4 card, but just because it is doesnt mean it isnt shit 😛
Well that and cola freestyle machines are insecure af, mcdonalds is sketchy.
Well there are clones.
Well there is a 0040 size byte section in a WC24 container for its crypto, we could try there (just a shot in the dark)
Well we aren't going to register a annocuments task to flood our server. (Larsen can you talk with em, I dont know what to tell em)
Well wii no ma on the side 🙂
Well yea, I mean the vff dumps dogmander had is our only hope, if we cant use those, yea we are dead.
Well yeah Larsen, you would always talk to me about my projects and stuff, not talk like this. https://prnt.sc/u5xb3h You and me would always have a decent conversation.
Well yeah, but I am active a lot + I release a lot of console schematics here + rare videos for you guys too.
Well yeah, its more of a illusion.
Well, first thing I'll do is binary analysis to see what links it goes to. From there, I either reverse engineer them or find archives of it. Then, Ill hook into Doordash, edit the code to be English and have other resurants such as Red robin, add some new categories and edit existing ones. From there, it should be a solid start.
Well, for me at least haha.
Well, for now, until my tool for that is ready 🙂
Well, I can inject icons and secure my code for one 🙂
Well, I want to make sure that people who access that page are a Wii..
Well, it's a pain since we are running headless...
Well, the auth error is still biting my butt trying to move it, but it will hopefully soon be resolved 🙂
Well, the screens were garbage on the DS. Take a look at that little fella for instance in the pic.
Well, the shopsdk backend is currently on one of my dev code repos, I have two of them where I host wii no ma development code.
Well, they did that to adapt to different sizes. Its a bit hard to explain why, I am actually a iOS hacker myself so I have the knowledge to sorta know what it does. Basically your device and my device, prob being different models, they have different icon sizes. So iOS automatically adpts to all of them. http://6100mifi-server-001.000webhostapp.com/cdn/ Here is some of my server data, from em to you 🙂
Well, they wont let you delete history when you work from home... and they have GoGuardian and eight other filters, so I didnt risk it (because I already have risked it enough tbh)
Well, we have the main server, the OSM server, and the secondary DNS server, and the CDN.
Were my tools helpful JG? 🙂
Wew, good morning everybody! Going to mod a PSP today! (and then the wii, and then the world! 😛 )
What drives me bonkers is Cloudflare actually leaks my team's emails to each other in the members page, they really need to not do that.
What have I done.. XD
What is happening with chrome lol
What's funny about that thet, is that they are copying the protegent commercial.
What's his name fluffy? I like parakeets, actually.
What's this notes you took Larsen? 🙂 https://github.com/larsenv/MarioCube-WC24/blob/master/downloads/Forecast%20Channel%20Junk%20Larsenv's%20Quick%20Mental%20Notepad.txt
What's wrong is that is bullying, you dolt.
When I get my second wii, Ill tell it.
Where's me spotlight? 🙂 I kinda wanna help.
Whew 🙂 We should be good then other than Wii mail, I will invite you over to the server Voaly before I go to bed, I will hopefully have some testing stuff ready for tommorow. See you there! :sunglasses_pika:
Which I eventually made this to grab the URL's from that.
Which in reality, I should have more than 15 if this is going to be tested well.
Who owns the server btw? Thinking of bungecording it with two of my MC servers 😄
Who rerembers MiiCharacters.com guys? I think larsen does, but how bout you guys? (You could upload miis and I have been told they have a CMOC server crawler)
Who would like to test a moderation bot with the creator of Luigi/O and me?
Who, me? 😛
Why did I do those forks of RC24 lol? Ig it was because I wanted it to run through github.io, I was such a noob 🤣
Why is that Mimi? You got something fun planned, I presume?
Wii Drunk Ma 😏
Wii Wifi Module Breakout Board, complete with 2 GND Expansion Ports. Altium Schematic Release eta now! 😄
Wiikeys are dead lol.
wiilink24.github.io/_layout/default.html should have it, I am also using this server to deliver Wii interviews that I collected.
Will do KCR 😄 Thanks for letting me come over to you guys, gonna be fun times. (Speaking of which, I wanted to ask y'all something.) Would anyone have interest in a secondary RC24 dns to replace the 8.8.8.8 that you normally put in the secondary dns field? You know, just so we have both a primary and a secondary one, not sure if people would be interested.
Will do Snoot 🙂
Will do then yea, but nevertheless I will do PoC tonight of flac playback on html, should I do the forecast channel banner music or the demae channel one mates, its your guys call
Will do 🙂
Will do, I might order it either this week or next week.
Will I now? 😛
Will post in a min 🙂
Will test tonight hopefully, this was fun 🙂
Wish granted, my friend.
With args too maybe Link and viewing of what it prints? Put it in the wiilink24 githun there Link, but yeah those are the other two features I want 🙂
With my mii? 😍
With wine it is lol
Woah let me try that 🙂
Working on debug mode for File-Maker, here is what I have so far
working on the dns login counter, and here is three of the many pages I made for it. File listings for it, to be exact!
Wow, ig my mii file is possessed then lol.
Wrong pic lol, one sec
XD & knuckles lol
Ya know what, I might just buy a 1tb and re-do my windows 10 lol
Ya know, for statspage 🙂
Yay! 🙂 That will be fun to do, considering Im already at 60% usage with Sentry, so I definitely want to bring that down. Do the other services come permeant too, like domain names? 🙂
Yea I am, thats sorta why I always say everything on my mind 😄
Yea we did, because you are pissing us off. That doesnt change anything however.
Yea, it was a gift and the wire is up agaisnt the tire. That and I almost died 6 times riding it on the first day 🤣
Yea, this is pissing me off a bit TerWebz, to be frank with you.
Yeah
Yeah about a hour before you came on, me and Larsen and the bois were discussing it, and im still so amazed we did it. Congrats guys!! 👏
Yeah and what I always found cool about the Wii U was they nicknamed the SDK based on the wii u's one. The wii u in my opinion is sorta the definitive Wii when it comes to non-vWii modding. As for posters, I actually have a MC one too ironically enough 😛
Yeah cfw wasn't even invented back then, those 3ds compatible flashcarts came WAY before then.
Yeah could you OSS it maybe? 🙂
Yeah cpu is maxed out lol
Yeah he had a 720p camera which was good, excellent quality vids 😄
Yeah he's a cute little cat 😄
Yeah he's pretty neat, speaking of which spotlight, the whole US/EU backend is going to be written in Go/C++/Perl/PHP for the ultimate speed. I am going to have fun making all of this, I can tell 🙂
Yeah I can de-minify it, actually, I might just revert to v9. #wfcc-dev Also we are developing a wfc connection service?
Yeah I determined that there is some region DRM, good god please let it not be metaforce.
Yeah I dont know the costs but it's SO easy to implement though, like VERY simple. You can do JSON profiles with the script I made 🙂
Yeah I have a lot of stuff for pentesting iOS, helps me quite a bit.
Yeah I have centurylink 🤣
Yeah I know, but it didnt see it?
Yeah I will have it send lots to owncloud for one 🙂
Yeah I wonder if there is any code for it, would be cool to see. Ill post my filepath, one sec
Yeah Ik.
Yeah it has those for completedness, scroll down you'll see it (Discord embed could be better imo)
Yeah it is a little cringy haha, I found this clock on a site because supposedly they sell them haha
Yeah it'll sorta display the commit hash, but yeah its not really a useful feature. (although BGM would be cool)
Yeah its Logitech, my mic is crap haha 😛
yeah its this thing Im looking for, there is numbers on it but I cant make them out.
Yeah its WIP, I put the checklist for what we need to do 🙂
Yeah Larsen made it before RC24 actually, I've been using it for my web design class.
Yeah me, Redbees, fluffy, keego, and the gang were laughing at them.
Yeah mkw and mii channel have gecko codes for that mii special characters stuff, as for the symbols, gimme one sec guys Ill find it
Yeah my cat wanted to snuggle with me, and he even gave me a long hug. He's a sweet little cat.
Yeah one exists :D looks fun to play with
Yeah PS3 never had region locking, so there was no need for region modding ever.
Yeah Redbees, It's a modded version from a warez community that I am in 😄 Thats where I got Aero Glass from
Yeah Snoot is spotlight, me and him met about a week after the team was formed, and yeah, it was good I did, because we made a insane amount of progress thanks to him. And yeah, I have plans to have the GloomConnect24 project be put into the WiiLink24 patcher, as it is directly related to the project. Should be fun :)
Yeah standalone, but easily portable to digicam.
Yeah sure thing 🙂 Meet you in dev vc
Yeah that's what I meant, I cant rerember the card that they flipped out about though.
Yeah that's why I keep going in and out
Yeah thats the one.
Yeah use wc24-dev then, well Larsen, see ya, imma go watch your sheep or weatherman vid 🙂
Yeah what did I do too bacon? Im a good buddy to you right??
Yeah wiiflow doesn't remove DRM/copy protection well from what I can tell. iirc I got 002 on accf with it.
Yeah 😦 I hope I can fix it
Yeah 🙂 see ya later Larsen, dogmander, ryal, and kgr 🙂
Yeah, and I was also thinking of having a population limit too. Not sure if it would be able to be on my Pi, but maybe we could cross-deploy perhaps.
Yeah, any nt 6.1 and nt 7.0 is prob me
Yeah, as you can tell by some of this stuff, I am a pentester :vaporeon_cool:
Yeah, but heck, we should be able to run cmoc though 🙂
Yeah, but like, actually making the data that goes into em. 😄 And yea, they were. Luckily... it's your lucky day, because I will post the source code in a min for a usb-gecko. 😄
Yeah, do a header. (that way, we can define whatever we need)
Yeah, I did get a little ahead of myself on that, but yeah tbh it is better not to flex and actually show work I think.
Yeah, I had too much fun with curling scripts haha :P
Yeah, I have been messing around with it lately, thought it would be a cool gimmick, although it is a bit of a small one admittingly.
Yeah, I know. Its a royal PITA, if you ask me.
Yeah, I need to clean up that dump from ebay. It was a little devkit picture dump that I did around when you and me first met Larsen. Heck, the messages are still in RGD message history from that.
Yeah, I threw a test mii in there just in case 🙂
Yeah, I will be sending him a clean ISO as he might have done something with his Windows build, I dont know.
Yeah, I will when I can 🙂
Yeah, I will 🙂
Yeah, Ig we arent really called that now that we moved to the bc24 name 🙂
Yeah, it was a brainfart, because I had been doing unzip transfers all last night
Yeah, it wont stop giving me this error Larsen, is there a comma I need to put somewhere? https://pastebin.com/tUBJtBqk
Yeah, its a really fun concept.
Yeah, its one of my favorite memories of me and him 🙂
Yeah, like when the menu is missing on US and stuff?
Yeah, me and my devs will look into it :)
Yeah, me and Spotlight are working on our new host, so luckily it wont be for long 🙂
Yeah, the server doesnt let it grab it for some reason.
Yeah, we can do that 🙂
Yeah, we will be, its kind of a test enviroment rn, we are rushing a bit 🙂
Yeah, we will prob move over to a different server for this, hey james I gotta run but can you invite Baconz to it?
Yeah. I can get it updated rn prob, I have the perfect Forecast music mp3 I wanna use.
Yep :) unowe recommended unbound to me
Yep Ciel, I am 🙂
Yep I do, I ride it outside when it isnt smoggy haha
Yep Spotlight, I am going to try to use Go code as much as possible, it should make things a lot more faster 🙂 Unforunately CMOC is going to take the longest to port I think.
Yep 😄
Yep 🙂
Yep 🙂 (I think)
Yep, a Pi 3 server for me to have CoWFC on and my other hosting crap.
Yep, and guess what it is? A full PCB reverse engineering of the Wii, Ill show you a pic one sec
Yep, I am. 😄
Yep, I have dumped wii.com 😄 (If you want zip, I can do that, one sec)
Yep, I've been closely watching everyone's work, from afar :pika_cool:
Yep, its me Im still alive (COVID wont get near me hehe)
Yep, that's the one alr. And yea, its basically transformer before it got killed. Hey Larsen, throw some random strings from some Wii stuff or something, Imma see what it comes out with 😄
Yep, we are. 😄
Yep, wii.com has been scanned 😎
Yep.
Yep. 🙂 Im going to try to figure out how to kill it, and use github education (it should map to a domain name I hope)
Yes I am a weeb 🤦‍♂️
Yes I do Larsen.
Yes I unplugged my second monitor and then THAT happened.
yes im lame lol
Yes 🙂
Yes, but sshhhh ~~its a secret~~. 😛
Yes, Discord now let's you talk in any server. WHY DISCORD
Yes, feel it, control it.
Yes, I am a datahoarder.
Yes, I am running a old modded Windows 7 version a friend gave me in 2016.
Yes, I have been misspelling tonight for some reason, Ig it's prob because I fell asleep a little too late. Also, that is interesting how they are rebooting it, considering everyone who like watched it is grown up now. Ig its still cool though. (I rerember when I dumped a Blue Clues DVD with DVD Shrink and Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate which was one of my first dips into archiving actually)
Yes, like you, I still like these shows 🙂
Yes, we have established that AI, that Hermoine got arrested for drugs. https://prnt.sc/u38b58
Yes, you are correct on that haha.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes... 😅
Yo @Voaly , got something cool to show you (Thanks LuigiBlood for showing me this!) https://youtu.be/xWIg3jQEn2E
Yo artuto, I have some of hypixel's plugins/maps. Maybe they would be useful to Libertyland?
Yo fluffy, you just woke up too eh?
Yo guys, mind if I show you a favorite wii game of mine? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEZEFs8tgmU The open-worldedness is acutally pretty amazing.
Yo Hxper, the server will begin its usage today! 😄 Let me fill you in. Your server is the most important server that my server needs. Why? ALL code is pulled from your server dynamically.
Yo hyper, you there mate? Got something really quick to tell ya. 🙂
Yo paniaal, speaking of BRSEQ's, fun fact, there was a MKDS sequence sample used in KTRAging.
Yo redbees, I played a smg2 midi once and guess what happened? It sounded like basketball, just rapidfire drum sounds and a weird synth note at the end.
Yo 👏 that would be dope in real life.
Yo, lit/dope.
Yoshi, I recongize you in your disquisce there.
You are correct that both use EXI.
You are correct, and in that exact phrase. But not exactly, Ill tell you why. You are on the right track however.
You as well, ax ol buddy 😄
You as well, I'm 6100m, the founder of WiiLink24, and the ex-ex-ex owner. 🙂
You can login with your github iirc, to finish off ShopSDK, I need your help a bit with the code and I'm hoping we could collab? 🙂
You can use Disk something something, I forget what it is called. But yeah, np 😄
You doing a face reveal Larsen? Neat.
You guessed right 🙂
You guys are important to me.
You guys hate it too then? Yeah, Im prob switching to SpaceX's internet tbh.
You guys wanna hear a song? Here we go.
You guys wanna hear something funnier about Atari, more funnier than the Jaguar?
You guys wanna see me take messages from the discord chat and auto-complete them with AI?
You hate me too then..? (Please dont ban me for saying that, I need to let that out.)
You have a fair point there unowe. (That would iirc burn you up, but not as fast as the sun)
You know Baconz, I have a excellent way to fix that. You wanna hear how?
You know what we should call him Redbees?
You know what, I am not even going to try with you TerWebz, you are a dolt-bolt and I am never speaking to you again. Your roasts are literally ALWAYS incorrect, have you noticed how people don't agree with you? You aren't in the right here pal. So, bye forever until you can grow up and get mature @TerWebz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDt8-6QQAXc Take that, guy who is in two games! 😛
You may, yeah 😄
You mean in the config??
You mean Larsen didnt pass that argument 😛
You mean my idea Larsen? 🙂
you might have to use my format changer, mkw, what format did you change it to? O, and I wanna be assigned to pokemon, gloom suit if ya can 🙂
You need protegent, the only software equipped with data recovery!
You see, SD isnt impedance matched well, thats why.
You think Gentoo is funny Baconz? You gotta be cuckoo-crazy! You want funny, 6100m show you funny. https://prnt.sc/u38d4q
You using the PCB I made for RGD then fluffy? 🙂
You will see urmum, you will see.
You'd be right that I didnt, my files are a mess currently, I cant keep up with the leaks XD
You'd have to ask Larsen on that, I only heard that we were doing it. And yes, mario 2 is my favorite NES game, so kudos on that. 😄 @ben/tubiek
You're actually cooking em Mkwii?
You're right, they would.
Youre darn straight it is, pasta is best 😄
Youre fine though, no worries
Yours. 🙂

😔 Never mind, I just want to get along with everyone.
🙂
🤔 Oh great, we will have to bruteforce it then... Kidding, I guarantee you the IV/Key is in the WC24 binary.
🥱 Good morning guys, Im still yawning from waking up yes. Had some spaghetti with nacho beans so I got the energy for today 😄
